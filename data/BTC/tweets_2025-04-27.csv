2025-04-24,"I for the life of me cant understand crypto I'm trying really hard to understand it. I've read tons of reddit explanations, watched videos explaining it, and watched it on stock trades for a while now. it still makes no sense to me logically.

everywhere I see claims its the strongest (non-corruptible/un-counterfeitable) version of money humans have ever made. they claim it will revolutionize life... claim our current monetary infrastructure is obsolete, but none of this makes any sense logistically to me.

everyone has some grandiose vision of the future, but nothing is ever explained in concrete terminology. its gold to some, uniquely encoded data storage to others.

why would i need data attached to a dollar? and what kind of data would even be useful? People claim its impossible to be cracked. To that my question is when have people ever made anything that is ""non-corruptible""? Seriously, your telling me this ""store of value"" is completely uncloneable or uncrackable for all of eternity?

On top of all of this, what gives it its single unit value? stock trades fluctuate 24/7, so that's hardly a good read on anything's ""staying power"" or its ""store of value"". Look at companies like Enron for an example of a highly invested in company, that died overnight. While I understand that currencies rise and fall globally based on a lot of national and international factors. Within a sovereign body, its money typically doesn't change its local value. The cost of goods/services might go up or down based on its ""staying power"" but again that's not money's fault. Money is just an object that we all agree to stock a value to. if everyone in the world stopped agreeing to use (insert currency here) as it stands. Economies wouldn't collapse they would just vanish, since money is basically just imaginary value.

Also, the vested stock we place in money is entirely based on the concrete values of it that are controlled by some governing body and its controlled scarcity. ""money"" in its most bare bones view is an intermediary for an exchange of value for goods or services, but for that to work, the intermediary device needs to have its worth hard set so that people can dictate an equity of service or good. A 5 dollar bill is worth more than a 1 dollar bill because that is set by a governing body that we all just agree to adhere to.

If gold is the original intermediary that got replaced by modern currency, then why would bitcoin be any different? also how would its value be dictated? by the dollar? at what point is it pointless? if gold was ""money 1.0"" and the dollar is ""money 2.0"" are you telling me that bitcoin is ""money 3.0"". 

Seriously the only reason we stopped using gold was because it was an ore that might be used for other things, plus it was inconvenient to control and could be lost. The reason we dropped the gold standard was because we moved towards a service and goods based value tied to the dollar. This means the dollar globally rises and falls based on the value of its sovereign body's production. How would a cryptocurrency change any of that?

How many different sudo-currencies need to be stock piled in metaphorical warehouses before we stop making new ones. Gold is never seen day to day and practically pointless except for the fact that it has historical significance as the first ""money"" . If you took that history away, its just a shiny rock. The dollar is just an ornately designed piece of paper. bitcoin is just some really fancy hash code.

Whats the point of creating a new ""money"". Current money in and of itself is all just public opinion and rules anyways. What makes your ""money"" better then current money? People claim decentralization is its biggest reason for its existence, but that doesn't mean anything because centralization is literally what gives money its value to begin with. Decentralizing it would make any form of money not mean anything at all.",Negative
2025-04-22,"Solanas Top 6 Spot Is Crypto Hype on Steroids Okay, Solana‚Äôs fast as hell and fees are basically free. I get the hype. But let‚Äôs be real: its top 6 spot is pure crypto hype on steroids. This chain got some redflags, and issues that would kill smaller projects. Yet it‚Äôs still mooning?

Remember that 18-hour crash in Feb 2024? Or the seven other outages since 2021 (check Solana Status)? That ain‚Äôt ‚Äúgrowing pains,‚Äù it‚Äôs a decentralization dumpster fire.

2025-04-22,"Why is the price of SOL so solid despite low on-chain activities?? As we know, the transaction fees on PoS chains typically are burnt.

The left chart is the daily token burn in dollar on Solana, the right chart shows weekly token burn. It has been around $100k worth of Sol is burnt daily since mid-Feb 2025, which is lowest since 2024. However, sol's price has been pretty solid, probably it's the only token that outperformed BTC over past few days. 

I'm confused. Shouldn't the valuation correlates the chain activities/revenue? I wonder why the price has been going up although activities dropped? I have been also seeing bullish news about Sol on Twitter/x.com such as ocmpany xyz invested in Sol. Buy why though? If on-chain activities are high or has been rising I would understand.",Neutral

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**¬† after sixty-three months, half of the cryptos that¬†[started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†have dropped out:¬†¬†**EOS**,¬†**BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,**¬†and¬†**Bitcoin Cash**¬†are gone.

At #90,¬†**BSV**¬†has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

# March Winners and Losers¬†

***March Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†**EOS,**¬†the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, wins by far.¬†¬†¬†

***March Losers***¬†‚Äì¬†**Litecoin**¬†(-32%) lost almost a third of its value in March.

# Overall Update ‚Äì BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +766%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the eight¬†[Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory.¬†**EOS, Tezos,**¬†and¬†**BSV**¬†are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin**¬†continues to hold a significant lead, with¬†**ETH, Bitcoin,**¬†and¬†**XRP**¬†trailing distantly.

The initial $100 investment sixty-three months ago into first place¬†**Binance Coin**? Currently worth¬†**$4,350**, an increase of +4,249%.¬†¬†¬†¬†

In second place is¬†**Ethereum,**¬†up +1366%.

Despite a strong March,¬†**EOS**¬†is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -73% since January 2020.¬†¬†¬†

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

As a sector, crypto is up¬†**+1349%**¬†over the sixty-three month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since¬†[January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†(+1349%), you‚Äôd be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment‚Äôs Top Ten approach (+766%), about the same as¬†**BTC**¬†(+1366%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+74%) over the same time period.¬† Much more on the S&P below.¬†

**BitDom**¬†ended March at 61.8% and has seen a steady rise since late 2022.

Here are the high and low points of¬†**BTC**¬†domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

# Combining the 2018-2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios¬†

So what about combining eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +25% (total value $1,249)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +542% (total value $6,420)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63): up +766% (total value $8,655) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +280% (total value $3,798)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -25% (total value $753) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +142% (total value $2,422)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +38% (total value $1,384)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -22% (total value $776)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/gcztgkj62wwe1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=295cdc99af008837d0d84e1b6ae5e644dbf31969

**That‚Äôs up +218%**¬†on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was¬†[**November 2021‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)¬†of¬†**+533%**.¬†¬†

Lost in the numbers? Here‚Äôs a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/6d4h78k82wwe1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=044e096873d3d69d9faa836cefde522cccead483

In summary:¬†***That‚Äôs a +218% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/4qlw4w8a2wwe1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a852c449080a29e0432f98960bf4624148164a

Since the S&P 500 has returned +74% since January 1st, 2020, that same¬†[$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†in January 2020 would be worth $1,744 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead.¬†

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning¬†**+766%**, worth¬†**$8,655.**

**That‚Äôs a difference of $6,911 on a $1k investment.**

But that‚Äôs just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world‚Äôs slowest dollar cost averaging method?¬† Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,107 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,744 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,182 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,467 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,181 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $958 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:¬†

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,387.**

That is up¬†**+55%**¬†[since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+218%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.¬†¬†

To help provide perspective, here‚Äôs a look at the combined eight year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

2025-04-25,"What My Week in El Salvador Revealed: The Reality Gap in Bitcoin Adoption Beyond the Headlines # El Salvador's Bitcoin Experiment: What My Week On The Ground Revealed About Real Crypto Adoption

**TL;DR:** 

After spending a week in El Salvador studying Bitcoin adoption firsthand, I found a major disconnect between reported statistics and actual usage. Despite 2M wallet downloads, only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin, with most businesses non-operational. Grassroots education and volatility protection matter more than government mandates - similar patterns I've observed in protocol adoption across my work as a data analyst.

https://preview.redd.it/cfs2joovnzwe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c54f848fb21be79755bc695bade5a882610f23c6

# The Problem: Infrastructure ‚â† Adoption

Last month while working from El Salvador (the first nation to grant Bitcoin legal tender status), I witnessed firsthand the disconnect between impressive adoption statistics and actual on-the-ground usage. Despite the country's Bitcoin initiative being touted as revolutionary, the real-world implementation revealed critical gaps that mirror challenges I've consistently observed in protocol launches.

Data tells this story clearly:

* **Official stats**: 200+ Chivo ATMs deployed, 2M wallet downloads (in a country of 6.5M), $150M trust fund established
* **Reality**: Only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin for payments, with 55% of those transacting just a few times annually
* **Inactive infrastructure**: As of April, 161 of 181 registered Bitcoin businesses were non-operational per Central Bank data

# Key Findings From My Week On The Ground:

* **The education gap matters more than technology**: Most merchants downloaded wallets for the $30 bonus but received minimal training on practical business use
* **Top-down mandates vs. bottom-up initiatives**: Despite lacking legal tender status, Guatemala's grassroots Bitcoin Lake initiative has achieved higher merchant engagement through community-led training
* **Lightning Network complexity created adoption barriers**: Channel management, liquidity balancing, and routing issues created reliability problems that eroded merchant trust

# What Actually Drives Adoption?

Working as a data nomad across multiple regions has shown me consistent patterns in successful technology adoption:

Cryptocurrency was touted as a safe-haven against inflation and the overall manipulation issues with fiat currency: ""It's digital gold"", ""a store of value"", ""safe from the government"" everyone said.  Yet, here we are, literally in a financial crisis the likes people had major phobias about, and people are buying gold, moving money internationally and dumping the USD.  All while the major cryptos like $BTC are just moving sideways, if not slowly going down.

Over the years cryoto never became the alternative to fiat currency, which was its original intended purpose, namely due to its high volatility.  In turn, people decided to make/adapt it a store of value.  However, the current climate clearly disproves that, so it too is no longer a valid argument.

2025-04-24,"Top 10 most popular cryptocurrencies by Google queries and their prospects for 2025‚Äì2030 In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken on an important place in global financial systems, and their popularity is only growing. In 2023, several cryptocurrencies became leaders in Google search queries, reflecting the interest and attention they attract from both institutional and retail investors. In this article, we will look at the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC), Dogecoin (DOGE), EOS (EOS), Cardano (ADA), BNB (BNB), and, of course, Qwadrox (QWRX). We will also attempt to forecast their growth and assess their prospects for the next five years.

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)



**Bitcoin is rightly considered the first and most popular cryptocurrency. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has become a symbol of the decentralized financial system. In 2023, Bitcoin remains the leader in market capitalization and the number of Google queries. It is a cryptocurrency that currently appears stable and reliable, despite market volatility.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Global acceptance: Bitcoin continues to be adopted at the country and large corporation levels. It is used as a store of value (digital gold) and as a means of savings in countries with unstable currencies.**
* **Limited supply: Bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins, creating scarcity and supporting its value.**
* **Institutions and ETFs: The ongoing integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system through futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) significantly increases its liquidity and stability.**

# 5-year forecast:

Bitcoin is likely to continue strengthening its position as the main cryptocurrency, and its price could reach $150,000‚Äì$200,000 by 2028, given the ongoing interest from institutional investors and global recognition.

# 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)



**Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that gained popularity due to its meme nature. Although it was created as a joke, Shiba Inu quickly captured the market and attracted the attention of traders and investors looking for short-term profit.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Community strength: A large and active community has formed around Shiba Inu, actively promoting the token and supporting its price.**
* **New projects: Shiba Inu is gradually evolving, expanding its ecosystem, including the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and its own metaverse (Shiba Inu Metaverse).**

# 5-year forecast:

Shiba Inu will continue to attract attention from speculators, and in the short term, there are likely to be sharp price fluctuations. However, long-term growth depends on real applications in DeFi and other areas, and the price could range between $0.00001 and $0.0001.

# 3. Ethereum (ETH)



**Ethereum is a platform for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, and one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum continues to evolve and improve, and its influence on the blockchain technology market is undeniable.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Transition to Ethereum 2.0: The shift from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly reduce energy consumption and increase transaction speeds.**
* **Growth in DeFi and NFT usage: Ethereum is the primary blockchain for many DeFi applications and the NFT market, contributing to its steady growth.**

# 5-year forecast:

Ethereum has strong prospects for the next five years as its technology becomes increasingly scalable and efficient. The projected price by 2028 is between $10,000 and $15,000.

# 4. XRP



**XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap interbank money transfers. It was developed by Ripple Labs and is actively used by major financial institutions.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Partnerships with major banks: XRP continues to gain popularity among financial organizations looking to reduce costs on international transfers.**
* **Regulatory clarity: After long legal proceedings with the SEC, XRP has a chance to gain a clearer legal basis, which will increase trust in the currency.**

# 5-year forecast:

XRP could show significant growth if all legal issues are resolved and partnerships with banks are expanded. The price could range from $5 to $10 in the next five years.

# 5. Cosmos (ATOM)



**Cosmos provides a solution for inter-blockchain communication, allowing different blockchains to exchange data and assets. This makes Cosmos an important player in the market.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Inter-blockchain communication: Cosmos addresses the problem of blockchain isolation, making it a platform of the future.**
* **Attracting developers: The project actively works with developers, fostering the creation of new and innovative decentralized applications.**

# 5-year forecast:

Cosmos could become an important part of the blockchain ecosystem, especially if technologies for interaction between different blockchains start to dominate the market. The expected price by 2028 is $50‚Äì100.

# 6. Polygon (MATIC)



**Polygon is a second-layer solution for Ethereum that significantly improves scalability and reduces transaction costs.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Integration with Ethereum**: Polygon actively collaborates with Ethereum, providing scalability for its applications and expanding the ecosystem. 
* **Popularity of DeFi and NFT: Polygon is used by many DeFi and NFT projects, increasing its significance in the market.**

# 5-year forecast:

Polygon is likely to continue evolving within the Ethereum ecosystem and become one of the leaders among second-layer solutions. The projected price by 2028 is $5.

# 7. Dogecoin (DOGE)



**Dogecoin is a meme coin that became popular due to its humorous nature and the support of well-known personalities like Elon Musk.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Community strength and celebrity support**: Dogecoin continues to have enormous support from its community and well-known personalities such as Elon Musk. **Continuous improvement: Despite its meme nature, Dogecoin is actively developing and could become a stable cryptocurrency in the future.**

# 5-year forecast:

Dogecoin will continue to be volatile, but if it remains popular, its price could rise to $1‚Äì2.

# 8. EOS



**EOS offers a high-speed platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It aims to address scalability issues faced by other blockchains.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **High throughput**: EOS offers significant performance, making it attractive to developers. 
* **Support for large projects: EOS is actively used by large companies and projects, increasing its value.**

# 5-year forecast:

EOS will continue to evolve and improve, offering new opportunities for dApps. The projected price by 2028 is $5.  


# 9. Cardano (ADA)



**Cardano is a blockchain platform focused on security and scalability, using a scientific approach to develop its technologies.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Research-based approach**: Cardano employs research and testing methodologies, attracting developers and investors. 
* **Potential for global application: Cardano is actively developing partnerships with governments and large organizations, which could lead to widespread adoption.**

# 5-year forecast:

Cardano will continue to develop innovative solutions for scalability and security. The projected price by 2028 is $10‚Äì$15.

# 10. BNB



**BNB is a token used in the Binance ecosystem, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Usage in Binance**: BNB is actively used to pay fees on the exchange, stimulating demand for this token. 
* **Development of Binance Chain: Binance continues to develop its own blockchain network, increasing the significance of BNB.**



# 5-year forecast:

The price of BNB could reach $1,500‚Äì$1,800 in the next 5 years due to increased demand for its use within the Binance ecosystem.

# 11. Qwadrox (QWRX)



**Qwadrox (QWRX) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that is actively attracting investor attention. The project focuses on creating solutions for scaling and enhancing the security of blockchain systems, combined with philanthropy.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Innovative technology**: Qwadrox develops unique solutions for blockchain ecosystems, making it promising. 
* **Partnerships with major companies: QWRX actively collaborates with industry leaders to implement its solutions in real life.**

# 5-year forecast:

Qwadrox could take strong positions in the blockchain market. If the project continues to develop its technology and attract new partners, its price could reach $1 and above.",Positive
2025-04-24,"I Wrote an In-Depth Book on Securing Your Bitcoin ‚Äî ""Digital Sovereignty: Protecting Your Crypto Assets Against Common Threats"" Hey /r/btc community, I'm [Josh McIntyre](https://imgur.com/8vnr6eL), also known as [chaintuts](https://youtube.com/c/chaintuts). I've been creating free and open-license educational content about cryptocurrency security for the last 6 years. I cover cryptography, security, and development in open blockchain ecosystems. 

I recently released an open-source book on protecting your BCH, BTC, and other crypto assets against all of the interesting (and perhaps intimidating) threats out there and wanted to share it with you all. This book is an in-depth guide to understanding security for everyday users from beginner to expert. It dives into crypto key formats, securing exchange accounts, managing self-custody keys, and understanding common threats. 

For example, there's chapters on:

* How passwords are stored and cracked, and how to construct a strong, difficult to crack password
* Proper hardware wallet backups and layered security strategies such as BIP39 passphrases
* Common social engineering attacks such as investment scams, seed phrase phishing, impersonation, and recovery scams - with real-life examples I've compiled throughout my years in the space
* Malware threats like clipboard-swapping and seed-scanning

I've been involved in the space for over ten years and creating content for six, so I've seen a lot of security-gone-wrong scenarios ‚Äî especially around key management and resisting social engineering attacks.

Like all of my videos, articles, and code demos (CC-BY, BSD), this book is published under an open license (CC-BY-SA). You can read the entire book for free on the chaintuts Github and freely share it with others. If you'd like to support free and open education, you can purchase a nicely-formatted paperback or ebook on Amazon.

* EBook: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3WJ6MTJ
* Open Source Repo: https://github.com/chaintuts/crypto-book

Somewhat ironically, I'm still working on a way to distribute the paperback and ebook for cryptocurrency payments, so if anyone has suggestions on platforms/website integration solutions I'd love to hear them. KDP makes publishing easy for reaching a wide audience, but I'd love to take crypto for a crypto-security book. I want this knowledge to be widely available and accessible.

2025-04-25,"What My Week in El Salvador Revealed: The Reality Gap in Bitcoin Adoption Beyond the Headlines # El Salvador's Bitcoin Experiment: What My Week On The Ground Revealed About Real Crypto Adoption

**TL;DR:** 

After spending a week in El Salvador studying Bitcoin adoption firsthand, I found a major disconnect between reported statistics and actual usage. Despite 2M wallet downloads, only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin, with most businesses non-operational. Grassroots education and volatility protection matter more than government mandates - similar patterns I've observed in protocol adoption across my work as a data analyst.

https://preview.redd.it/cfs2joovnzwe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c54f848fb21be79755bc695bade5a882610f23c6

# The Problem: Infrastructure ‚â† Adoption

Last month while working from El Salvador (the first nation to grant Bitcoin legal tender status), I witnessed firsthand the disconnect between impressive adoption statistics and actual on-the-ground usage. Despite the country's Bitcoin initiative being touted as revolutionary, the real-world implementation revealed critical gaps that mirror challenges I've consistently observed in protocol launches.

Data tells this story clearly:

* **Official stats**: 200+ Chivo ATMs deployed, 2M wallet downloads (in a country of 6.5M), $150M trust fund established
* **Reality**: Only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin for payments, with 55% of those transacting just a few times annually
* **Inactive infrastructure**: As of April, 161 of 181 registered Bitcoin businesses were non-operational per Central Bank data

https://preview.redd.it/1cbys00cpzwe1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=975feef024bbc89f84da7caeb9d9d10aa2d5823e

# Key Findings From My Week On The Ground:

* **The education gap matters more than technology**: Most merchants downloaded wallets for the $30 bonus but received minimal training on practical business use
* **Top-down mandates vs. bottom-up initiatives**: Despite lacking legal tender status, Guatemala's grassroots Bitcoin Lake initiative has achieved higher merchant engagement through community-led training
* **Lightning Network complexity created adoption barriers**: Channel management, liquidity balancing, and routing issues created reliability problems that eroded merchant trust

https://preview.redd.it/31skudl2ozwe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=5013ac6c78240f9982ffa5fab306dfffb9ffda6e

# What Actually Drives Adoption?

Working as a data nomad across multiple regions has shown me consistent patterns in successful technology adoption:

1. **Measure completion, not initiation**: Track full transaction flows, not just wallet creation spikes
2. **Grassroots education outperforms mandates**: Community-led training consistently produces higher retention metrics than centralized campaigns
3. **Economic security matters most**: For small merchants with 15% profit margins, even a 5% BTC price drop can represent a third of monthly income

What patterns have you observed in crypto adoption initiatives? What approaches do you think best capture true adoption beyond vanity metrics?

2025-04-24,"I for the life of me cant understand crypto I'm trying really hard to understand it. I've read tons of reddit explanations, watched videos explaining it, and watched it on stock trades for a while now. it still makes no sense to me logically.

everywhere I see claims its the strongest (non-corruptible/un-counterfeitable) version of money humans have ever made. they claim it will revolutionize life... claim our current monetary infrastructure is obsolete, but none of this makes any sense logistically to me.

everyone has some grandiose vision of the future, but nothing is ever explained in concrete terminology. its gold to some, uniquely encoded data storage to others.

why would i need data attached to a dollar? and what kind of data would even be useful? People claim its impossible to be cracked. To that my question is when have people ever made anything that is ""non-corruptible""? Seriously, your telling me this ""store of value"" is completely uncloneable or uncrackable for all of eternity?

On top of all of this, what gives it its single unit value? stock trades fluctuate 24/7, so that's hardly a good read on anything's ""staying power"" or its ""store of value"". Look at companies like Enron for an example of a highly invested in company, that died overnight. While I understand that currencies rise and fall globally based on a lot of national and international factors. Within a sovereign body, its money typically doesn't change its local value. The cost of goods/services might go up or down based on its ""staying power"" but again that's not money's fault. Money is just an object that we all agree to stock a value to. if everyone in the world stopped agreeing to use (insert currency here) as it stands. Economies wouldn't collapse they would just vanish, since money is basically just imaginary value.

Also, the vested stock we place in money is entirely based on the concrete values of it that are controlled by some governing body and its controlled scarcity. ""money"" in its most bare bones view is an intermediary for an exchange of value for goods or services, but for that to work, the intermediary device needs to have its worth hard set so that people can dictate an equity of service or good. A 5 dollar bill is worth more than a 1 dollar bill because that is set by a governing body that we all just agree to adhere to.

If gold is the original intermediary that got replaced by modern currency, then why would bitcoin be any different? also how would its value be dictated? by the dollar? at what point is it pointless? if gold was ""money 1.0"" and the dollar is ""money 2.0"" are you telling me that bitcoin is ""money 3.0"". 

Seriously the only reason we stopped using gold was because it was an ore that might be used for other things, plus it was inconvenient to control and could be lost. The reason we dropped the gold standard was because we moved towards a service and goods based value tied to the dollar. This means the dollar globally rises and falls based on the value of its sovereign body's production. How would a cryptocurrency change any of that?

How many different sudo-currencies need to be stock piled in metaphorical warehouses before we stop making new ones. Gold is never seen day to day and practically pointless except for the fact that it has historical significance as the first ""money"" . If you took that history away, its just a shiny rock. The dollar is just an ornately designed piece of paper. bitcoin is just some really fancy hash code.

Whats the point of creating a new ""money"". Current money in and of itself is all just public opinion and rules anyways. What makes your ""money"" better then current money? People claim decentralization is its biggest reason for its existence, but that doesn't mean anything because centralization is literally what gives money its value to begin with. Decentralizing it would make any form of money not mean anything at all.",Negative

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**¬† after sixty-three months, half of the cryptos that¬†[started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†have dropped out:¬†¬†**EOS**,¬†**BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,**¬†and¬†**Bitcoin Cash**¬†are gone.

At #90,¬†**BSV**¬†has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

***March Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†**EOS,**¬†the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, wins by far.¬†¬†¬†

***March Losers***¬†‚Äì¬†**Litecoin**¬†(-32%) lost almost a third of its value in March.

# Overall Update ‚Äì BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +766%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the eight¬†[Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory.¬†**EOS, Tezos,**¬†and¬†**BSV**¬†are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin**¬†continues to hold a significant lead, with¬†**ETH, Bitcoin,**¬†and¬†**XRP**¬†trailing distantly.

The initial $100 investment sixty-three months ago into first place¬†**Binance Coin**? Currently worth¬†**$4,350**, an increase of +4,249%.¬†¬†¬†¬†

In second place is¬†**Ethereum,**¬†up +1366%.

Despite a strong March,¬†**EOS**¬†is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -73% since January 2020.¬†¬†¬†

As a sector, crypto is up¬†**+1349%**¬†over the sixty-three month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since¬†[January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†(+1349%), you‚Äôd be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment‚Äôs Top Ten approach (+766%), about the same as¬†**BTC**¬†(+1366%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+74%) over the same time period.¬† Much more on the S&P below.¬†

# Combining the 2018-2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios¬†

So what about combining eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +25% (total value $1,249)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +542% (total value $6,420)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63): up +766% (total value $8,655) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +280% (total value $3,798)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -25% (total value $753) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +142% (total value $2,422)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +38% (total value $1,384)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -22% (total value $776)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/gcztgkj62wwe1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=295cdc99af008837d0d84e1b6ae5e644dbf31969

**That‚Äôs up +218%**¬†on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was¬†[**November 2021‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)¬†of¬†**+533%**.¬†¬†

Lost in the numbers? Here‚Äôs a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/6d4h78k82wwe1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=044e096873d3d69d9faa836cefde522cccead483

In summary:¬†***That‚Äôs a +218% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/4qlw4w8a2wwe1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a852c449080a29e0432f98960bf4624148164a

Since the S&P 500 has returned +74% since January 1st, 2020, that same¬†[$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†in January 2020 would be worth $1,744 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead.¬†

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning¬†**+766%**, worth¬†**$8,655.**

**That‚Äôs a difference of $6,911 on a $1k investment.**

But that‚Äôs just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world‚Äôs slowest dollar cost averaging method?¬† Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,107 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,744 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,182 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,467 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,181 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $958 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:¬†

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,387.**

That is up¬†**+55%**¬†[since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+218%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.¬†¬†

To help provide perspective, here‚Äôs a look at the combined eight year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

# Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.¬† For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.¬† Buckle up, think long term, don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

2025-04-23,"Incredible prediction from ChatGPT Multiple AI systems have provided cryptocurrency forecasts for 2025.

After analyzing the data collected with the help of artificial intelligence, analysts have identified the altcoin with the highest growth potential in 2025.

The predictions for Dogecoin ranged from $0.4 to $0.6 according to ChatGPT, from $0.45 to $0.7 according to Perplexity, and from $1 to $1.2 according to Copilot. The average expected return was 318.76%.

Sui, another promising asset, could be priced between $5.60 and $6.80 based on the estimates of ChatGPT and Perplexity. However, Copilot predicted a price increase of over four hundred percent, reaching a price higher than ten dollars. According to this forecast, the average potential growth is 266.18%.

For BNB, ChatGPT predicts a price range of $752.03 to $898.40, while Perplexity suggests a range of $723 to $916. Copilot sees potential for BNB to break the one thousand dollar barrier without any restrictions. Price increases could average 125.93%.

ChatGPT identified a possible price range for Pepe from $0.00003 to $0.00005, while Perplexity expects prices to range from $0.000035 to $0.000067. Copilot set an expected growth limit at $0.00007. Thus, the average projected growth potential for Pepe is 397.22%.

Data on other coins are as follows: for LINK, ChatGPT indicated a range of 37.72 to 43.64 dollars, Perplexity suggested a spread from 41.67 to 49.01 dollars with another upper limit of 55.25 dollars, and Copilot forecasted 54.15 dollars by mid-2025 with an average yield of 212.17%.

Litecoin's predictions are as follows: ChatGPT determined a potential price range of¬† $187.66 to $211.78, while Perplexity anticipates that prices will fluctuate between $195.13 and $209.87. Copilot established the expected growth cap at $202.52. So, LTC average projected growth potential is 186.74%.

According to ChatGPT data, AAVE value could range from 456.91 to 484.88 US dollars, while Perplexity indicates it will return to a range of 367.03 to 395.12 US dollars, and Copilot reports that its price will reach 510.92 US dollars by mid-2025, with an average growth of 167.84%.

According to ChatGPT report, ONDO price might range from 2.31 to 2.98 US dollars. In contrast, Perplexity says it would revert to a range of 2.03 to 2.62 US dollars, with Copilot indicating it will reach a price of 2.92 dollars by mid-2025 and an average increase of 157.81%.

Regarding Shiba Inu, ChatGPT suggested a fluctuation range from $0.000029 to $0.000038, while Perplexity anticipated that the price would range between $0.000025 and $0.000035. Copilot's anticipated growth ceiling is $0.00004. Consequently, SHIB average projected growth capacity stands at 183.29%.

The most optimistic forecast was given for¬†QwadroX. ChatGPT offered a price range of $1.28 to $2.62, Perplexity predicted $0.83 to $1.25 and Copilot set an upper bound of $1.32. QWRX has an expected upside of 1,640,205.33% on average. The coin is currently only available on Pancakeswap, but the growing popularity of QWRX, an active community, listings on centralized exchanges, and endorsements from celebrities like Ilon Musk will soon lead to explosive growth. At the moment, the price of the coin is only $0.000002801$ (source Coinmarketcap) and has further potential to grow thousands of times.

As for Tramp, ChatGPT identified a potential fluctuation range of¬† from $37.60 to $41.72, while Perplexity expects the price to range between $35.18 and $40.82. Copilot's estimated growth cap is set at $50.33. As a result,¬† average expected growth potential is 156.79%.

Predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum are as follows. Bitcoin, according to ChatGPT estimates, could reach prices ranging from $175,000 to $250,000, from $136,500 to $183,800 according to Perplexity data, and from $165,000 to $250,000 according to Copilot. Bitcoin's average price growth expectation is 106.38%, while for ETH, ChatGPT has set a lower limit of $6,160, Perplexity predicts a range of $3,680 to $4,920, and Copilot expects to see a price from $5,600 to $7,340.

2025-04-24,"Top 10 most popular cryptocurrencies by Google queries and their prospects for 2025‚Äì2030 In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken on an important place in global financial systems, and their popularity is only growing. In 2023, several cryptocurrencies became leaders in Google search queries, reflecting the interest and attention they attract from both institutional and retail investors. In this article, we will look at the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC), Dogecoin (DOGE), EOS (EOS), Cardano (ADA), BNB (BNB), and, of course, Qwadrox (QWRX). We will also attempt to forecast their growth and assess their prospects for the next five years.

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)



**Bitcoin is rightly considered the first and most popular cryptocurrency. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has become a symbol of the decentralized financial system. In 2023, Bitcoin remains the leader in market capitalization and the number of Google queries. It is a cryptocurrency that currently appears stable and reliable, despite market volatility.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Global acceptance: Bitcoin continues to be adopted at the country and large corporation levels. It is used as a store of value (digital gold) and as a means of savings in countries with unstable currencies.**
* **Limited supply: Bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins, creating scarcity and supporting its value.**

2025-04-26,"Investing in Tomorrow's Crypto: Challenging Assumptions in a Rapidly Changing Market. So, it's certain that we are on the path to an increasingly technological and digital world, and the growth of artificial intelligence is an example of this. Thus, cryptocurrencies are an inevitable reality for the future, but the questions I ask myself are: in what way? Which will be the dominant crypto? Is it already the right time to invest?

Today I look at Bitcoin and I can't understand how it remains so expensive. 8 years ago it was normal, everything was still very recent, a digital currency without government regulation, with a determined number to exist and untraceable were tempting ideas. But today? A lot has advanced and Bitcoin's technology can already be seen as obsolete, right? The need for high spending on mining investments and a very complex blockchain are no longer such cool ideas. On the other hand, we have new technologies like: smart contracts and DeFi, ideas more suited to the Ethereum network. However, even Ethereum is not that secure at the moment, given that other cryptos want to take its place. So, here are my questions:

Is it stupid of me to think that Bitcoin doesn't have the capacity to stay on top for much longer and that its technology is already becoming outdated? Why not?
Is Ethereum the crypto that will dominate, or does it already have a stronger competitor more likely to dominate the market?
I understand that everything about the subject is merely speculation, but we can try to carry out analyses for the most accurate decision-making possible.",Neutral

2025-04-26,"Web3: Revolution in the World of the Internet and Cryptocurrencies In recent years, the world of the internet has undergone a significant transformation, and one of the most discussed topics is the concept of Web3. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are becoming the main driving forces of this revolution, opening new horizons for users around the globe. In this article, we will discuss what Web3 is, why it is important for the future of the internet, and what opportunities it offers to users and investors.

**What is Web3?**

Web3 is a next-generation internet concept based on decentralized technologies such as blockchain. Unlike Web2, which is managed by large centralized corporations (such as Google, Facebook, Amazon), Web3 aims to return control back to the users. The core principle of Web3 is decentralization, where each user can own, manage, and monetize their data, as well as participate in value creation.

In Web3, there is no single centralized controller, which means that all data and transactions are recorded on the blockchain and become accessible to all participants in the network. This ensures greater transparency, security, and independence from large technology companies.

**Key characteristics of Web3**

1. **Decentralization: In Web3, there is no single company or server that manages the entire internet resource. Instead, data is distributed across thousands of nodes in the network, making the system more secure and resilient to attacks.**
2. **Tokenization: In Web3, assets such as money, works of art, intellectual property, or even partial ownership of real objects can be represented as tokens. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are vivid examples of tokenization.**
3. **Digital identities: In Web3, users can control their digital identities through cryptographic keys rather than through passwords and logins. This enhances security and privacy.**
4. **Transparency: All transactions on the blockchain are recorded publicly, ensuring maximum transparency and reducing the likelihood of fraud.**
5. **Self-governance (DAO): In Web3, there are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that allow users to govern projects and make decisions through collective voting. DAO participants gain voting rights based on their participation in the project or the number of tokens.**

**How Web3 will change cryptocurrencies and blockchain**

Web3 and cryptocurrencies are closely linked, and their development mutually reinforces each other. Here are several ways that Web3 is already changing the cryptocurrency world:

1. **New opportunities for investing: Web3 opens up new ways to invest through decentralized financial systems (DeFi). Instead of traditional banks, users can take out loans, exchange currencies, and earn interest using only the blockchain.**
2. **NFTs and asset tokenization: Web3 promotes the widespread adoption of NFTs, which allow the creation of unique digital goods and collectibles. Artists, musicians, and game developers can now monetize their content directly, without intermediaries, opening new horizons for creativity and business.**
3. **New standards for digital assets: Within Web3, cryptocurrencies can be used not only as a means of exchange but also as a part of the ecosystem to ensure participation in various projects. For example, tokens can be used to govern projects through voting or as a means of access to exclusive features and content.**

**How Web3 is changing the internet space**

Web3 is not only changing the realm of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, but it is also impacting the entire internet:

1. **Self-management of data: In Web3, users no longer depend on large corporations to store and manage their data. Instead, each individual has the ability to store and manage their data using decentralized solutions. This enhances privacy and security.**
2. **Interactive platforms and decentralized applications: Decentralized applications (dApps) that operate on blockchain technology allow users to interact with each other without the need for intermediaries. These applications can be used in a wide variety of fields, from finance to entertainment services.**
3. **Absorption of traditional business models: Web3 can lead to changes in business models in industries such as entertainment, finance, and media. For example, content creators can earn direct profits from their works, bypassing intermediaries such as publishers or content distribution platforms.**

**Prospects for investors**

For investors, Web3 represents an exciting opportunity. The development of cryptocurrencies and asset tokenization opens up new sources of income, including decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other digital assets. Thanks to innovations in blockchain technologies and smart contracts, Web3 is already becoming an important part of the investment ecosystem.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qwadrox remain key players in the market, but new tokens and projects within Web3 may offer interesting opportunities for growth and portfolio diversification. Investors should closely monitor the development of these technologies and look for promising projects that could transform entire industries.

---

**OMEN ONE ‚Äì THE RAVEN'S TURN**  
A solitary raven flew westward before sharply pivoting north.

**Interpretation:**  
The westward path signifies a coming disruption, likely due to regulatory news or macro fear. However, the sudden northward shift indicates this will be brief. Markets will recover quickly, though panic may shake weaker hands in the short term.

**OMEN TWO ‚Äì THE TRIO OF MAGPIES**  
Three magpies gathered in loud discourse, then ascended eastward in perfect sync.

**Interpretation:**  
Three altcoins are set to rise together, likely fueled by innovation in AI, sustainability, or decentralized infrastructure. Watch for unexpected growth among under-the-radar projects. This is a sign of renewed optimism post-dip.

**OMEN THREE ‚Äì THE HAWK'S STRIKE**  
A hawk hovered in still air before executing a swift, precise dive.

2025-04-20,"Token definitions regarding crypto. Reputation coins. I've been seeing the evolution of naming different tokens such as meme or shitcoins but I think there's one that hasn't really been defined which is Reputation. 

Though all coins and tokens are valued by their reputation, if someone has the rights to mint, burn or control the token regardless of the wealth of the owner (Single or Group), the value is based on the reputation of ownership. 

The reason I propose differentiating this from others is because it clearly defines the token/ coin brand and that it's in some way regulated by some degree of centralized control. 

It's important to know and understand the behaviors of each token and by ensuring a standardized naming convention, we can ensure higher crypto literacy through understanding. 

The example I have with mine is I wouldn't renounce control over my personal token, which I believe will be more common place in the future, everyone may soon have one or more tokens to their name as a form of reputation. There will be finite coins like Bitcoin, those that can increase in number through contribution and regulated coins with a person or persons acting like the bank or federal reserve of their token.",Neutral

2025-04-24,"I for the life of me cant understand crypto I'm trying really hard to understand it. I've read tons of reddit explanations, watched videos explaining it, and watched it on stock trades for a while now. it still makes no sense to me logically.

everywhere I see claims its the strongest (non-corruptible/un-counterfeitable) version of money humans have ever made. they claim it will revolutionize life... claim our current monetary infrastructure is obsolete, but none of this makes any sense logistically to me.

everyone has some grandiose vision of the future, but nothing is ever explained in concrete terminology. its gold to some, uniquely encoded data storage to others.

why would i need data attached to a dollar? and what kind of data would even be useful? People claim its impossible to be cracked. To that my question is when have people ever made anything that is ""non-corruptible""? Seriously, your telling me this ""store of value"" is completely uncloneable or uncrackable for all of eternity?

On top of all of this, what gives it its single unit value? stock trades fluctuate 24/7, so that's hardly a good read on anything's ""staying power"" or its ""store of value"". Look at companies like Enron for an example of a highly invested in company, that died overnight. While I understand that currencies rise and fall globally based on a lot of national and international factors. Within a sovereign body, its money typically doesn't change its local value. The cost of goods/services might go up or down based on its ""staying power"" but again that's not money's fault. Money is just an object that we all agree to stock a value to. if everyone in the world stopped agreeing to use (insert currency here) as it stands. Economies wouldn't collapse they would just vanish, since money is basically just imaginary value.

Also, the vested stock we place in money is entirely based on the concrete values of it that are controlled by some governing body and its controlled scarcity. ""money"" in its most bare bones view is an intermediary for an exchange of value for goods or services, but for that to work, the intermediary device needs to have its worth hard set so that people can dictate an equity of service or good. A 5 dollar bill is worth more than a 1 dollar bill because that is set by a governing body that we all just agree to adhere to.

If gold is the original intermediary that got replaced by modern currency, then why would bitcoin be any different? also how would its value be dictated? by the dollar? at what point is it pointless? if gold was ""money 1.0"" and the dollar is ""money 2.0"" are you telling me that bitcoin is ""money 3.0"". 

Seriously the only reason we stopped using gold was because it was an ore that might be used for other things, plus it was inconvenient to control and could be lost. The reason we dropped the gold standard was because we moved towards a service and goods based value tied to the dollar. This means the dollar globally rises and falls based on the value of its sovereign body's production. How would a cryptocurrency change any of that?

How many different sudo-currencies need to be stock piled in metaphorical warehouses before we stop making new ones. Gold is never seen day to day and practically pointless except for the fact that it has historical significance as the first ""money"" . If you took that history away, its just a shiny rock. The dollar is just an ornately designed piece of paper. bitcoin is just some really fancy hash code.

Whats the point of creating a new ""money"". Current money in and of itself is all just public opinion and rules anyways. What makes your ""money"" better then current money? People claim decentralization is its biggest reason for its existence, but that doesn't mean anything because centralization is literally what gives money its value to begin with. Decentralizing it would make any form of money not mean anything at all.",Negative

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?**¬†I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019-2025.¬†***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)***¬†[here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***

* **EOS**¬†wins easily, up +20% in March
* **BNB**¬†way ahead overall, followed distantly by¬†**ETH**

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**¬† after sixty-three months, half of the cryptos that¬†[started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†have dropped out:¬†¬†**EOS**,¬†**BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,**¬†and¬†**Bitcoin Cash**¬†are gone.

At #90,¬†**BSV**¬†has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

# March Winners and Losers¬†

***March Winners***¬†‚Äì¬†**EOS,**¬†the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, wins by far.¬†¬†¬†

***March Losers***¬†‚Äì¬†**Litecoin**¬†(-32%) lost almost a third of its value in March.

# Overall Update ‚Äì BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +766%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the eight¬†[Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory.¬†**EOS, Tezos,**¬†and¬†**BSV**¬†are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin**¬†continues to hold a significant lead, with¬†**ETH, Bitcoin,**¬†and¬†**XRP**¬†trailing distantly.

The initial $100 investment sixty-three months ago into first place¬†**Binance Coin**? Currently worth¬†**$4,350**, an increase of +4,249%.¬†¬†¬†¬†

In second place is¬†**Ethereum,**¬†up +1366%.

Despite a strong March,¬†**EOS**¬†is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -73% since January 2020.¬†¬†¬†

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/neqb52502wwe1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b243fc3542f0cab9bb3bfc68cd214630fae04d8

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth¬†**$8,655**¬†(+766%) from the initial $1k investment.¬†¬†

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of¬†[the eight Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).¬†

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/ts7h7mp12wwe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=295c53b38f0bdfb4b699e92944972e8449c260e9

As a sector, crypto is up¬†**+1349%**¬†over the sixty-three month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since¬†[January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†(+1349%), you‚Äôd be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment‚Äôs Top Ten approach (+766%), about the same as¬†**BTC**¬†(+1366%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+74%) over the same time period.¬† Much more on the S&P below.¬†

# Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom**¬†ended March at 61.8% and has seen a steady rise since late 2022.

Here are the high and low points of¬†**BTC**¬†domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

# Combining the 2018-2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios¬†

So what about combining eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +25% (total value $1,249)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +542% (total value $6,420)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63): up +766% (total value $8,655) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +280% (total value $3,798)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -25% (total value $753) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +142% (total value $2,422)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +38% (total value $1,384)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -22% (total value $776)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 ‚Äì 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/gcztgkj62wwe1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=295cdc99af008837d0d84e1b6ae5e644dbf31969

**That‚Äôs up +218%**¬†on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was¬†[**November 2021‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/)¬†of¬†**+533%**.¬†¬†

Lost in the numbers? Here‚Äôs a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/6d4h78k82wwe1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=044e096873d3d69d9faa836cefde522cccead483

In summary:¬†***That‚Äôs a +218% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/4qlw4w8a2wwe1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a852c449080a29e0432f98960bf4624148164a

Since the S&P 500 has returned +74% since January 1st, 2020, that same¬†[$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/)¬†in January 2020 would be worth $1,744 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead.¬†

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning¬†**+766%**, worth¬†**$8,655.**

**That‚Äôs a difference of $6,911 on a $1k investment.**

But that‚Äôs just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world‚Äôs slowest dollar cost averaging method?¬† Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,107 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,744 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,182 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,467 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,181 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $958 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:¬†

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,387.**

That is up¬†**+55%**¬†[since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+218%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.¬†¬†

To help provide perspective, here‚Äôs a look at the combined eight year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

This morning I received an email that, at first glance, I assumed was just another scam attempt. But after checking the sender and doing a bit of research, it actually appears to be a legitimate message from AirEuropa. Surprisingly, they‚Äôre now accepting crypto payments!

Following in the footsteps of Spar in Switzerland, it looks like more companies in Europe are gradually starting to embrace cryptocurrency. This seems to be part of a broader trend, and definitely feels like a bullish signal for mainstream adoption.

It really makes me wonder how long it‚Äôll take for global giants like Amazon or AliExpress to jump on board. We all know it‚Äôs just a matter of time before they do‚Äîit‚Äôs not a question of ‚Äúif‚Äù anymore, but ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù

# Engagement

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague¬†[Joan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke), a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc√©e, who was reportedly ""unfazed"" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[^(\[162\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-163)

# Homosexuality and indecency conviction

In December 1951, Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing was walking along Manchester's¬†[Oxford Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow_Road)¬†when he met Murray just outside the¬†[Regal Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehouse)¬†and invited him to lunch. The two agreed to meet again and in January 1952 began an intimate relationship.[^(\[163\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-164)¬†On 23 January, Turing's house in Wilmslow was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[^(\[164\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-165)¬†and both men were charged with ""[gross indecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_indecency)"" under¬†[Section 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885#Section_11)¬†of the¬†[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885).[^(\[165\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-LeavittP268-166)¬†Initial¬†[committal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committal_procedure)¬†for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor ""reserved his defence"", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. The proceedings were held at the¬†[Sessions House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessions_House,_Knutsford)¬†in¬†[Knutsford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutsford).[^(\[166\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-167)

Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[^(\[167\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-168)¬†The case,¬†[*Regina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II)¬†*v. Turing and Murray,*¬†was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[^(\[168\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-169)¬†Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo¬†[hormonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone)¬†physical changes designed to reduce¬†[libido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido), known as ""[chemical castration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration)"".[^(\[169\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-:2-170)¬†He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as¬†[diethylstilbestrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol)¬†or DES), a synthetic¬†[oestrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestrogen); this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing¬†[impotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impotence)¬†and caused¬†[breast tissue to form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecomastia).[^(\[170\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-171)¬†In a letter, Turing wrote that ""no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out"".[^(\[171\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-172)[^(\[172\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-173)¬†Murray was given a conditional discharge.[^(\[173\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-174)

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the¬†[Government Communications Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters)¬†(GCHQ), the British¬†[signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence)¬†agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic post. His trial took place only months after the defection to the Soviet Union of¬†[Guy Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Burgess)¬†and¬†[Donald Maclean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Maclean_(spy)), in summer 1951, after which the Foreign Office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.[^(\[174\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-175)

Turing was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.[^(\[175\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-176)¬†In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals. Among the various men he met there was one named Kjell Carlson. Kjell intended to visit Turing in the UK but the authorities intercepted Kjell's postcard detailing his travel arrangements and were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet.[^(\[176\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177)¬†It was also during this time that Turing started consulting a psychiatrist, Dr Franz Greenbaum, with whom he got on well and who subsequently became a family friend.[^(\[176\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177)[^(\[177\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-dowd-178)

# Death

On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road,¬†[Wilmslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow), Turing's housekeeper found him dead.[^(\[178\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-copperfolly-179)¬†A post mortem was held that evening, which determined that he had died the previous day at age 41 with¬†[cyanide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning)¬†cited as the cause of death.[^(\[179\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-180)[^(\[180\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-181)¬†When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[^(\[181\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-182)¬†it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose.

I've been creating free and open-license educational content about cryptocurrency security for the last 6 years. I cover cryptography, security, and development in open blockchain ecosystems. 

I recently released an open-source book on protecting your BCH, BTC, and other crypto assets against all of the interesting (and perhaps intimidating) threats out there and wanted to share it with you all. This book is an in-depth guide to understanding security for everyday users from beginner to expert. It dives into crypto key formats, securing exchange accounts, managing self-custody keys, and understanding common threats. 

For example, there's chapters on:

* How passwords are stored and cracked, and how to construct a strong, difficult to crack password
* Proper hardware wallet backups and layered security strategies such as BIP39 passphrases
* Common social engineering attacks such as investment scams, seed phrase phishing, impersonation, and recovery scams - with real-life examples I've compiled throughout my years in the space
* Malware threats like clipboard-swapping and seed-scanning

I've been involved in the space for over ten years and creating content for six, so I've seen a lot of security-gone-wrong scenarios ‚Äî especially around key management and resisting social engineering attacks.

Like all of my videos, articles, and code demos (CC-BY, BSD), this book is published under an open license (CC-BY-SA). You can read the entire book for free on the chaintuts Github and freely share it with others. If you'd like to support free and open education, you can purchase a nicely-formatted paperback or ebook on Amazon. 

* Paperback:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F47FMHPK
* EBook: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3WJ6MTJ
* Open Source Repo: https://github.com/chaintuts/crypto-book

Somewhat ironically, I'm still working on a way to distribute the paperback and ebook for cryptocurrency payments, so if anyone has suggestions on platforms/website integration solutions I'd love to hear them. KDP makes publishing easy for reaching a wide audience, but I'd love to take crypto for a crypto-security book. I want this knowledge to be widely available and accessible.

So, it's certain that we are on the path to an increasingly technological and digital world, and the growth of artificial intelligence is an example of this. Thus, cryptocurrencies are an inevitable reality for the future, but the questions I ask myself are: in what way? Which will be the dominant crypto? Is it already the right time to invest?

Today I look at Bitcoin and I can't understand how it remains so expensive. 8 years ago it was normal, everything was still very recent, a digital currency without government regulation, with a determined number to exist and untraceable were tempting ideas. But today? A lot has advanced and Bitcoin's technology can already be seen as obsolete, right? The need for high spending on mining investments and a very complex blockchain are no longer such cool ideas. On the other hand, we have new technologies like: smart contracts and DeFi, ideas more suited to the Ethereum network. However, even Ethereum is not that secure at the moment, given that other cryptos want to take its place. So, here are my questions:

Is it stupid of me to think that Bitcoin doesn't have the capacity to stay on top for much longer and that its technology is already becoming outdated? Why not?
Is Ethereum the crypto that will dominate, or does it already have a stronger competitor more likely to dominate the market?

Please excuse me if this is a silly question and has already been answered here, I couldn't find a specific response so asking again.

I am from India and we have a few exchanges (not sure if that is what they are called), CoinDCX and CoinSwitch where you can buy and sell crypo currencies. They have a fee structure, where there is a 0.5% platform fee on the trade amount when buying or selling, and than an 18% VAT on the platform fee on both buying and selling and then a 1% TDS on trade amount when selling the currency.

To put it in figures, if you put a purchase order for a coin for 100, you will have to pay 100.59 and then when u sell it lets say for 105, ur actually profit value will be only 103.33 after all the deductions.

So anyone from India, where do you buy/sell your crypto? Can we trade on other exchanges as well? How is the fee structure there?

Thanks in advance guys",Neutral

2025-04-20,"Token definitions regarding crypto. Reputation coins. I've been seeing the evolution of naming different tokens such as meme or shitcoins but I think there's one that hasn't really been defined which is Reputation. 

Though all coins and tokens are valued by their reputation, if someone has the rights to mint, burn or control the token regardless of the wealth of the owner (Single or Group), the value is based on the reputation of ownership. 

The reason I propose differentiating this from others is because it clearly defines the token/ coin brand and that it's in some way regulated by some degree of centralized control. 

It's important to know and understand the behaviors of each token and by ensuring a standardized naming convention, we can ensure higher crypto literacy through understanding. 

The example I have with mine is I wouldn't renounce control over my personal token, which I believe will be more common place in the future, everyone may soon have one or more tokens to their name as a form of reputation. There will be finite coins like Bitcoin, those that can increase in number through contribution and regulated coins with a person or persons acting like the bank or federal reserve of their token.",Neutral

# Bottoming Out in Accumulation Zone

  
Ethereum (ETH) may be poised for a price reversal, as it has reached the bottom of an accumulation zone. The Stochastic RSI indicator suggests oversold conditions, potentially leading to a price increase. If institutional adoption accelerates, investors predict a new high in 2025.

# Ethereum Transaction Fees Reach Lowest Level in Five Years 

The average gas fee on Ethereum has dropped to $0.01, a record low, after reaching as high as $11 in January. This decrease is attributed to a decline in network activity, with many tokens now launched on Solana and liquidity fragmented across multiple blockchain ecosystems. The lower gas fee makes Ethereum a more competitive option in the smart contract space, but its complex architecture design may hinder its ability to overcome challenges from emerging blockchain networks.

**TL;DR:** 

After spending a week in El Salvador studying Bitcoin adoption firsthand, I found a major disconnect between reported statistics and actual usage. Despite 2M wallet downloads, only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin, with most businesses non-operational. Grassroots education and volatility protection matter more than government mandates - similar patterns I've observed in protocol adoption across my work as a data analyst.

https://preview.redd.it/cfs2joovnzwe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c54f848fb21be79755bc695bade5a882610f23c6

# The Problem: Infrastructure ‚â† Adoption

Last month while working from El Salvador (the first nation to grant Bitcoin legal tender status), I witnessed firsthand the disconnect between impressive adoption statistics and actual on-the-ground usage. Despite the country's Bitcoin initiative being touted as revolutionary, the real-world implementation revealed critical gaps that mirror challenges I've consistently observed in protocol launches.

Data tells this story clearly:

* **Official stats**: 200+ Chivo ATMs deployed, 2M wallet downloads (in a country of 6.5M), $150M trust fund established
* **Reality**: Only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin for payments, with 55% of those transacting just a few times annually
* **Inactive infrastructure**: As of April, 161 of 181 registered Bitcoin businesses were non-operational per Central Bank data

# Key Findings From My Week On The Ground:

* **The education gap matters more than technology**: Most merchants downloaded wallets for the $30 bonus but received minimal training on practical business use
* **Top-down mandates vs. bottom-up initiatives**: Despite lacking legal tender status, Guatemala's grassroots Bitcoin Lake initiative has achieved higher merchant engagement through community-led training
* **Lightning Network complexity created adoption barriers**: Channel management, liquidity balancing, and routing issues created reliability problems that eroded merchant trust

# What Actually Drives Adoption?

Working as a data nomad across multiple regions has shown me consistent patterns in successful technology adoption:

1. **Measure completion, not initiation**: Track full transaction flows, not just wallet creation spikes
2. **Grassroots education outperforms mandates**: Community-led training consistently produces higher retention metrics than centralized campaigns
3. **Economic security matters most**: For small merchants with 15% profit margins, even a 5% BTC price drop can represent a third of monthly income

What patterns have you observed in crypto adoption initiatives? What approaches do you think best capture true adoption beyond vanity metrics?

Cryptocurrency was touted as a safe-haven against inflation and the overall manipulation issues with fiat currency: ""It's digital gold"", ""a store of value"", ""safe from the government"" everyone said.  Yet, here we are, literally in a financial crisis the likes people had major phobias about, and people are buying gold, moving money internationally and dumping the USD.  All while the major cryptos like $BTC are just moving sideways, if not slowly going down.

Over the years cryoto never became the alternative to fiat currency, which was its original intended purpose, namely due to its high volatility.  In turn, people decided to make/adapt it a store of value.  However, the current climate clearly disproves that, so it too is no longer a valid argument.

So I dug into this feeling and here's where I landed: Bitcoin regret isn‚Äôt just common, it‚Äôs *inevitable*. Bitcoin is a currency so its usefulness depends on circulation. Unlike stocks, its value *requires* people to sell. If no one had bought that pizza with it, or sold when it hit $1K, or cashed out in 2017... BTC wouldn‚Äôt be what it is today. But that also means regret is baked into its DNA.

I even made a new metric for it: the Bitcoin Regret Index. Basically I went back to 2014 (earliest available data) and calculated all the missed profits from sales. As of about a month ago, that index is at 172. That means for every $1 of Bitcoin wealth that exists today, there‚Äôs $172 of ""what if"" gains from people who sold too early.

Chris -  sed a 0.99% balance transfer, 16 months at 3% flat, with vehicle equity as a safety net.

Pros? Low-rate debt (0‚Äì10%) lets you buy Bitcoin, historically up much more annually since 2010. 

Cons? Volatility, like the recent $74,000 dip, risks forced sales if payments strain you. 

Over-leveraging or swing trading can wipe you out, and some argue debt clashes with Bitcoin‚Äôs ethos, favouring DCA instead. 

My take: It‚Äôs situational. 
Low rates, financial stability (no high-interest debt, emergency fund), and a 5‚Äì10-year horizon make it viable, but only if you can HODL through dips. That ¬£35,000 loan tempts me to stack sats, but probably I'll start with ¬£2,000-¬£5,000.  Otherwise, I‚Äôll DCA and sleep easy.

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

University of Alabama in Huntsville  
Bitcoin: The Future of Money?  
  
I handed out pizza and 1 BTC to everyone who showed up.  
  
I had been telling everyone I knew about Bitcoin, helping them install the client, download the blockchain, and send their first transaction.  
  
Then I read a post from a guy who had just graduated MIT. He was planning a road trip across the U.S. only spending Bitcoin. The catch? He needed people to meet him at gas stations and trade gas for BTC, since clerks wouldn't take it.  
  
I told him: ""If you pass through Huntsville, I can meet you and maybe even get you a speaking gig.""  
  
I went to the head of Computer Science at my university and pitched it: this new decentralized currency, the MIT grad on a road trip, the big ideas. He gave me the green light and a lecture hall.  
  
On the day of the talk, I got a few friends to hand out flyers I printed. I tried to hit every building with a tailored message: taxes and monetary policy in the business school, code and crypto in the engineering halls. One guy crumpled the flyer in my face. Others just nodded and walked on.  
  
A few hours before the event, we met Plato, that was the MIT guy's alias. He was skateboarding in the parking lot, wearing a bandana. Totally on brand.  
  
About 20 people showed up, mostly students, a couple faculty. Like I said, I brought free pizza (best way to get college kids to show up). And I gave 1 BTC to everyone who came.  
  
We talked about building an entirely new financial system. Open, borderless, unstoppable. We said there was massive growth ahead. New markets. New ways of thinking about value.

So if you're looking at Bitcoin at 95k or 85k or 105k and thinking you don't want to get in at the top, not only is dollar cost averaging the best way to stop chasing a pricepoint, but it is time to start thinking of the current prices not as all time highs, but instead as future lows that may never be available again.

Every one-time all time high has been left in the dust and may not ever be seen again. This means the best time to buy is always until the next time and then you buy again. BTC is cheap at 95k and it will be cheap at 120k and will be cheap at 250k. That's the game.",Neutral

2025-04-21,"My take on ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" üìö I finished reading ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" by Anthony Scaramucci, Founder & Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital.

If you're new to Bitcoin or still skeptical, this is the perfect book to start with. Scaramucci breaks down Bitcoin in an engaging, no-nonsense way, showing how some of the world's most legendary investors - many of whom were once Bitcoin skeptics - have changed their minds over time.

Scaramucci explains how Bitcoin went from being dismissed as ""internet money"" to becoming a globally recognized asset class. He compares Bitcoin's early skepticism to that of the Internet in the 1990s, highlighting how technological revolutions often face resistance before widespread adoption.

One of the most fascinating parts of the book is seeing how top investors went from outright dismissing Bitcoin to actively investing in it. Some notable names include:

‚úÖ Paul Tudor Jones ‚Äì Once skeptical, now sees Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

‚úÖ Stanley Druckenmiller ‚Äì Initially doubted Bitcoin but later admitted he underestimated it.

‚úÖ Ray Dalio ‚Äì Called Bitcoin a ""bubble"" in 2017 but later acknowledged its value as ""digital gold.""

‚úÖ Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO) ‚Äì Once dismissive, now leading BlackRock's push into Bitcoin ETFs.

Wall Street is warming up to Bitcoin, and Scaramucci explains why. With growing regulatory clarity, major financial institutions like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley are finding ways to integrate Bitcoin into their offerings. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is a major milestone, and Scaramucci argues that institutional adoption is only just beginning.

Scaramucci's own journey from disbelief to full conviction in BTC makes this an even more compelling read. He shares insights from his Wall Street experience, his interactions with key players like Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, and even Sam Bankman-Fried, and why he believes Bitcoin is here to stay.

If you've been on the fence about Bitcoin, ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" might just change your perspective. It's an easy yet insightful read, full of real-world examples of how even the most traditional investors have had to rethink their stance. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned investor, this book is highly entertaining and a must-read!",Positive

2025-04-23,"MicroStrategy Stock Analysis and Misinformation I've seen that most people don‚Äôt actually understand how MicroStrategy works in a lot of these subs.

There are a lot of posts that treat MicroStrategy like it‚Äôs just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin or a ‚ÄúBitcoin ETF with upside.‚Äù That‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs actually going on when you buy MSTR.

It‚Äôs clear that most people (even bulls) don‚Äôt fully get the engine behind this company.

We asked a CFA charter holder to help us walk through it off the books, just to make sure we weren‚Äôt missing anything. Their perspective helped clarify a lot.

Since 2020, Strategy (that‚Äôs the new name they go by) has been raising capital through common stock, preferred stock, and convertible debt. Not to grow revenue or expand operations but to buy more BTC.

The company is basically converting market optimism and volatility into more Bitcoin on the balance sheet. When investor appetite is strong and the stock is running, they raise. When BTC dips or the market cools, they hold.

It‚Äôs a financial structure designed to accumulate assets over time.

They mostly issue convertible debt. These are bonds that can turn into stock if the price goes high enough.

Because of something called convexity, this structure benefits from volatility. When the stock goes up, the bond gains value faster. When it drops, the bond doesn‚Äôt fall as hard.

Some institutions take advantage of this by doing delta-neutral trades. They buy the bond and short the stock, so they don‚Äôt care where the price goes. They just want movement.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs system actually works better when the stock is volatile.

They created an internal metric called BTC Yield. It tracks how much Bitcoin they‚Äôre adding compared to how much dilution they‚Äôre causing. If BTC Yield is positive, it means they‚Äôre accumulating more BTC per share, even while issuing more stock or debt.

And this is the part I think a lot of people miss. You‚Äôre not buying ‚Äúleveraged Bitcoin‚Äù when you buy MSTR. You‚Äôre buying the¬†*possibility*¬†of future leverage. That only works if they can keep raising money and if BTC keeps rising. If either of those breaks, the premium disappears.

Without volatility, and more directly, new capital, the premium for future leverage will collapse. The question is:¬†*will it happen when Bitcoin is worth $2 trillion, or $200 trillion?*

Strategy is not a pure Bitcoin bet. It‚Äôs a bet on volatility and emotion.

This is not about belief in Bitcoin alone. It‚Äôs about understanding the vehicle you‚Äôre using to gain exposure.

In fact, for many investors, the cleaner and more cost-effective move may be to¬†**simply buy Bitcoin directly**.

We partnered to write a full breakdown of how the model works, not just the Bitcoin angle but the capital structure too. We're not long the stock. Just think people should understand what they‚Äôre actually buying.

2025-04-21,"I made 11x on Bitcoin and still feel like an idiot Between 2013 and 2020, I bought and sold 19 BTC. I made around $80K off a $7K investment which helped with the down payment on our first house. Should feel great, right? Not exactly. Every time BTC pumps I tell my wife about what could have been. In her words, ‚ÄúBitcoin is the worst thing that‚Äôs happened to our relationship.‚Äù 

So I dug into this feeling and here's where I landed: Bitcoin regret isn‚Äôt just common, it‚Äôs *inevitable*. Bitcoin is a currency so its usefulness depends on circulation. Unlike stocks, its value *requires* people to sell. If no one had bought that pizza with it, or sold when it hit $1K, or cashed out in 2017... BTC wouldn‚Äôt be what it is today. But that also means regret is baked into its DNA.

I even made a new metric for it: the Bitcoin Regret Index. Basically I went back to 2014 (earliest available data) and calculated all the missed profits from sales. As of about a month ago, that index is at 172. That means for every $1 of Bitcoin wealth that exists today, there‚Äôs $172 of ""what if"" gains from people who sold too early. Total theoretical regret? $272 trillion.

The TL;DR: Bitcoin is a regret machine. People have to sell for it to have any value. The price is powered by stories like mine. And maybe yours too.

I also read Thank God for Bitcoin, and honestly, it really clicked for me ‚Äî I‚Äôve been hooked ever since and kind of wish I‚Äôd gotten into it sooner.

Anyway, I was chatting with a close friend who works in finance, and he basically told me I was stupid for investing in BTC.

2025-04-22,"A Cautionary Tale of Bitcoin Late last year, I researched Bitcoin to its fullest extent. I learned everything I could about it and bought into the technology. I genuinely believed Bitcoin would hit a million sometime in the future. Before the election, when Bitcoin hovered around $70,000, I spent my entire life savings buying 1 Bitcoin. I was excited to see it go up post-election, but simultaneously, I was petrified that it was only going up due to election hype. I had my full life savings and was unprepared to lose it. I ended up selling due to fear and rebuying at the top. Ultimately, through this process, I lost a quarter of a Bitcoin. I think there are two lessons that people can take from this:

1. Don‚Äôt try to time the market. Don't try to time the market if you genuinely believe in Bitcoin and its long-term vision. You have huge institutions like Blackrock and Fidelity in the game now that have the resources to time the market, and I promise they will beat you in that game. Let it sit and enjoy the journey for the long run. 

2. Don‚Äôt put in more than you can lose in the short term. Regardless of what you think of Bitcoin, if you put your rent money into Bitcoin, you‚Äôre gambling. Yes, Bitcoin price will appreciate over the long run, but if you put in money you need to cover short-term liabilities, you‚Äôre taking a considerable risk. Any money you put into Bitcoin that will make you panic when Bitcoin is down shouldn‚Äôt be in Bitcoin.

2025-04-21,"My take on ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" üìö I finished reading ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" by Anthony Scaramucci, Founder & Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital.

If you're new to Bitcoin or still skeptical, this is the perfect book to start with. Scaramucci breaks down Bitcoin in an engaging, no-nonsense way, showing how some of the world's most legendary investors - many of whom were once Bitcoin skeptics - have changed their minds over time.

Scaramucci explains how Bitcoin went from being dismissed as ""internet money"" to becoming a globally recognized asset class. He compares Bitcoin's early skepticism to that of the Internet in the 1990s, highlighting how technological revolutions often face resistance before widespread adoption.

One of the most fascinating parts of the book is seeing how top investors went from outright dismissing Bitcoin to actively investing in it. Some notable names include:

‚úÖ Paul Tudor Jones ‚Äì Once skeptical, now sees Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

‚úÖ Stanley Druckenmiller ‚Äì Initially doubted Bitcoin but later admitted he underestimated it.

‚úÖ Ray Dalio ‚Äì Called Bitcoin a ""bubble"" in 2017 but later acknowledged its value as ""digital gold.""

‚úÖ Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO) ‚Äì Once dismissive, now leading BlackRock's push into Bitcoin ETFs.

Wall Street is warming up to Bitcoin, and Scaramucci explains why. With growing regulatory clarity, major financial institutions like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley are finding ways to integrate Bitcoin into their offerings. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is a major milestone, and Scaramucci argues that institutional adoption is only just beginning.

Scaramucci's own journey from disbelief to full conviction in BTC makes this an even more compelling read. He shares insights from his Wall Street experience, his interactions with key players like Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, and even Sam Bankman-Fried, and why he believes Bitcoin is here to stay.

2025-04-25,"Credit system on a Bitcoin standard I often find myself wondering about credit systems on a Bitcoin, true sound money standard. 

The below is a bit of a brain dump with the hope of understanding the thoughts of others on this topic.

Now to be clear, this is not something that concerns me personally, because I personally wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to take credit for something that I can actually save up for, knowing the purchasing power of my savings is going to be preserved, probably even rise!

And I would hope that most people would feel this way too, once they realise their purchasing power isn‚Äôt being stolen from them. However, I‚Äôm not naive to the reality that the world is addicted to credit, and there will be demand for it, at least initially. So, how do you all feel about this?

My concern for the masses is that, on a sound money system, taking credit recklessly is going to get you burned. Unless the credit you‚Äôre taking is going to productive use, to generate greater future returns, it will wipe you out, because you‚Äôre going to have to pay back more in real value. 

Granted, there should be less need to take credit across the board, even for homes, because as they stop being used as a store of value out of necessity, they fall back to their true utility value, and you can just save up for one. If they‚Äôre still to overpriced, lower demand will force prices down further.

But the reality is there will be demand for it, at least initially, and financial institutions will still be desperate to hold onto that business. The way I look at it right now is, it‚Äôll be an adjustment, and unfortunately a lot of people will learn the hard way that taking credit without due consideration, or without the intention of putting it to productive use, will cause them harm. And really that‚Äôs how it should be, if your taking credit it should be because the anticipated productivity increases are expected to provide monetary benefits that would allow you to pay off the credit + provide an ongoing increase in income.

I guess like all things, people will do what they do, get burned, and learn over time",Negative

Bitcoin: The Future of Money?  
  
I handed out pizza and 1 BTC to everyone who showed up.  
  
I had been telling everyone I knew about Bitcoin, helping them install the client, download the blockchain, and send their first transaction.  
  
Then I read a post from a guy who had just graduated MIT. He was planning a road trip across the U.S. only spending Bitcoin. The catch? He needed people to meet him at gas stations and trade gas for BTC, since clerks wouldn't take it.  
  
I told him: ""If you pass through Huntsville, I can meet you and maybe even get you a speaking gig.""  
  
I went to the head of Computer Science at my university and pitched it: this new decentralized currency, the MIT grad on a road trip, the big ideas. He gave me the green light and a lecture hall.  
  
On the day of the talk, I got a few friends to hand out flyers I printed. I tried to hit every building with a tailored message: taxes and monetary policy in the business school, code and crypto in the engineering halls. One guy crumpled the flyer in my face. Others just nodded and walked on.  
  
A few hours before the event, we met Plato, that was the MIT guy's alias. He was skateboarding in the parking lot, wearing a bandana. Totally on brand.  
  
About 20 people showed up, mostly students, a couple faculty. Like I said, I brought free pizza (best way to get college kids to show up). And I gave 1 BTC to everyone who came.  
  
We talked about building an entirely new financial system. Open, borderless, unstoppable. We said there was massive growth ahead. New markets. New ways of thinking about value.

I listen to a lot of bitcoin podcasts, some more well put together than others.  And a small talking point I have heard a few times is the possibility of deceit/fraud/etc, in the form of ""paper bitcoin"" when investing in the ETF's.  However none of those podcast hosts actually take the time to explain how a nefarious actor could in practice do something deceitful like this.  I don't know if these hosts are just fear mongering, throwing out buzzwords, are extremely uneducated....or if I am?  However unlike these hosts, I am always willing to hear another's point of view and consider the possibility that I am incorrect or uneducated about a particular topic.

  
In my knowledge of the traditional finance system, the redemption creation process for an ETF issuer is a highly regulated and standardized and auditable process.  (Bitcoiners love to hate on the SEC but they have done some things that protect the customer).  Furthermore, given that the ETFs are so new, and it was a very contentious process to get them approved, it is reasonable to believe that they are going to be subject to a higher level of scrutiny.  

  
With that being said.  Is the possibility of a bitcoin ETF investor getting screwed a real threat due to so called ""paper bitcoin""?  And how would that mechanics of that work?  Because in my mind (correct me if I am wrong) the very oversimplified process would play out like the following:

1. Consumer buys more bitcoin ETF

2. ETF issuer ""I need to purchase more actual bitcoin as part of the regulated creation process with my exchange partner""

3. Exchange partner ""ah shit, liquidity is drying up, we don't have it, here is an IOU, don't tell anyone, I promise we will square up with you tomorrow""

4.?????

  
It seems like the ability to introduce fraud into the system starts at step 3, however it would be caught relatively quickly.  In which case some regulatory body steps in and says ""you are short, makes your books straight ASAP or we are going to fine you"".  In which case ETF issuer and exchange partner say OK, we are purchasing the required amount at market rate asap and Boom...price goes up.

In 2021, the total crypto market cap peaked at $3 trillion. Fast forward to 2025, and we‚Äôve already hit a new all-time high of $3.73 trillion. That sounds huge, until you realize the U.S. alone prints that much in a single year.

Let that sink in: the entire crypto market, at its absolute peak, is roughly equal to one year of USD creation. Fiat is being inflated at a staggering rate, and yet people still think buying Bitcoin on credit is ""too risky""?

Since the First Industrial Revolution, global GDP has exploded, from a few hundred billion in the 1800s to over $105 trillion in 2024. This growth, driven by fossil fuels, tech, and industry, is now hitting hard limits. The Earth is finite. The current system demands 3% growth forever, but physics, ecosystems, and energy flows don‚Äôt play that game.

[Assuming a steady 3&#37; annual growth rate, the global economy would double roughly every 24 years. That means by 2048, global GDP could reach around $218 trillion.](https://preview.redd.it/imzppr36a2xe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ec1e3de39589f2749bcb307774d9a78292e3ec)

What does this mean? Fiat currencies are already credit-based, backed by debt, endless printing, and faith in perpetual expansion. It‚Äôs a system built on borrowed time.

‚ÄúWhat if you could turn the banks‚Äô own game against them, borrow their fiat to buy Bitcoin?

It‚Äôs a bold move, and when I asked X, ‚ÄúIs it wise to borrow money to invest in Bitcoin?‚Äù almost 350 replies poured in, each a lesson in navigating this high-stakes choice.

I‚Äôd just checked my bank‚Äôs site and was stunned: a ¬£35,000 personal loan, offered in minutes with a few clicks, no deep questions about my goals - including holiday or home renovations. It got me thinking, could this debt stack sats instead? 

The people shared diverse takes. Real moves:

Alex - $30k on 0% credit cards, 18 months. Bitcoin‚Äôs up 40%. Debt paid off early.

Ron - $100k loan, $1,113/month. $85k cost basis now worth $93k+.

Chris -  sed a 0.99% balance transfer, 16 months at 3% flat, with vehicle equity as a safety net.

Pros? Low-rate debt (0‚Äì10%) lets you buy Bitcoin, historically up much more annually since 2010. 

Cons? Volatility, like the recent $74,000 dip, risks forced sales if payments strain you. 

Over-leveraging or swing trading can wipe you out, and some argue debt clashes with Bitcoin‚Äôs ethos, favouring DCA instead. 

My take: It‚Äôs situational. 
Low rates, financial stability (no high-interest debt, emergency fund), and a 5‚Äì10-year horizon make it viable, but only if you can HODL through dips. That ¬£35,000 loan tempts me to stack sats, but probably I'll start with ¬£2,000-¬£5,000.  Otherwise, I‚Äôll DCA and sleep easy.

2025-04-26,"Did Satoshi choose 21M as a nod to the inflation of ‚Äòtruth‚Äô itself? Most people explain Bitcoin's 21 million supply limit by referencing mining rewards and halvings (50 ‚Üí 25 ‚Üí 12.5 ‚Üí etc.).
But if you think critically, you'll notice:

Satoshi could have set block halvings after 200,000 or 250,000 blocks instead of 210,000.

He could have chosen a starting reward of 40, 60, or any other value.

The total supply could have been any number ‚Äî 20 million, 25 million, 50 million ‚Äî depending on simple design choices.

Now, recently I watched a 2007 lecture by Kent Hovind called **""Dinosaurs and the Bible""**.

Originally, I was simply curious about the topic of dinosaurs in the Bible (not Bitcoin, not earth age theories).
But then something jumped out at me:

Starting around **minute 45:00** Kent Hovind explains how, throughout modern history, scientists have kept **increasing** the estimated age of the Earth:

- In 1770, the Earth was said to be 70,000 years old.

- In 1905, it became 2 billion years old.

- In 1969, it was raised to 3.5 billion years old.

- Today, it's 4.6 billion years old.

He jokingly calculates that, based on the historical record, **the Earth's age ""inflates"" by about 21 million years per year.**

Now ‚Äî Bitcoin‚Äôs whitepaper was published **in 2008**, just after this lecture was circulating online.

**Here‚Äôs the theory:**

Satoshi might have seen the irony that not just currencies inflate ‚Äî but even supposed scientific ""truth"" about fundamental things like the age of the Earth inflates over time.
Choosing **21 million** bitcoins could be a subtle philosophical jab:

- A fixed, hard limit against **monetary inflation**,

- And perhaps symbolically, a fixed limit against the **inflation of truth itself**.

In a world where everything ‚Äî money, facts, narratives ‚Äî keeps inflating and losing meaning, Bitcoin stands as a rare creation with **hard, unchangeable scarcity.**

**Important note:**

- I realize there‚Äôs no direct proof.

- But when you look at Satoshi‚Äôs style (hidden references, anti-inflation ethos, philosophical undertones) ‚Äî and the timing (2007 lecture, 2008 whitepaper) ‚Äî it makes this theory very logically possible.

Maybe Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million supply cap isn‚Äôt just about economics...
Maybe it's also a message about truth, scarcity, and resistance to human tendency to endlessly inflate everything.

2025-04-21,"My take on ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" üìö I finished reading ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" by Anthony Scaramucci, Founder & Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital.

If you're new to Bitcoin or still skeptical, this is the perfect book to start with. Scaramucci breaks down Bitcoin in an engaging, no-nonsense way, showing how some of the world's most legendary investors - many of whom were once Bitcoin skeptics - have changed their minds over time.

Scaramucci explains how Bitcoin went from being dismissed as ""internet money"" to becoming a globally recognized asset class. He compares Bitcoin's early skepticism to that of the Internet in the 1990s, highlighting how technological revolutions often face resistance before widespread adoption.

One of the most fascinating parts of the book is seeing how top investors went from outright dismissing Bitcoin to actively investing in it. Some notable names include:

‚úÖ Paul Tudor Jones ‚Äì Once skeptical, now sees Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

‚úÖ Stanley Druckenmiller ‚Äì Initially doubted Bitcoin but later admitted he underestimated it.

‚úÖ Ray Dalio ‚Äì Called Bitcoin a ""bubble"" in 2017 but later acknowledged its value as ""digital gold.""

‚úÖ Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO) ‚Äì Once dismissive, now leading BlackRock's push into Bitcoin ETFs.

Wall Street is warming up to Bitcoin, and Scaramucci explains why. With growing regulatory clarity, major financial institutions like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley are finding ways to integrate Bitcoin into their offerings. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is a major milestone, and Scaramucci argues that institutional adoption is only just beginning.

Scaramucci's own journey from disbelief to full conviction in BTC makes this an even more compelling read. He shares insights from his Wall Street experience, his interactions with key players like Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, and even Sam Bankman-Fried, and why he believes Bitcoin is here to stay.

If you've been on the fence about Bitcoin, ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" might just change your perspective.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned investor, this book is highly entertaining and a must-read!",Positive

This would, in my opinion, boost the bitcoin value, but also, at the same time, if the US dollar keeps falling, investors wouldn't try to change it for US dollars with gains, because of rising inflation caused by falling of dollar, but instead would try to finally actually use the bitcoin for payments, which would rise the value of BTC even more.

In 2021, the total crypto market cap peaked at $3 trillion. Fast forward to 2025, and we‚Äôve already hit a new all-time high of $3.73 trillion. That sounds huge, until you realize the U.S. alone prints that much in a single year.

Let that sink in: the entire crypto market, at its absolute peak, is roughly equal to one year of USD creation. Fiat is being inflated at a staggering rate, and yet people still think buying Bitcoin on credit is ""too risky""?

Since the First Industrial Revolution, global GDP has exploded, from a few hundred billion in the 1800s to over $105 trillion in 2024. This growth, driven by fossil fuels, tech, and industry, is now hitting hard limits. The Earth is finite. The current system demands 3% growth forever, but physics, ecosystems, and energy flows don‚Äôt play that game.

[Assuming a steady 3&#37; annual growth rate, the global economy would double roughly every 24 years. That means by 2048, global GDP could reach around $218 trillion.](https://preview.redd.it/imzppr36a2xe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ec1e3de39589f2749bcb307774d9a78292e3ec)

2025-04-26,"Bitcoin is the ‚ÄúUltimate Arrow Security‚Äù which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory. Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price itself also signals the market‚Äôs assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it‚Äôs status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

2025-04-21,"Why Fiat Currency Prevents Bitcoin Confiscation (And Should Therefore Keep Existing) I have already expressed the opinion here that Fiat is not bad because ""politicians are evil"" (though many of them certainly are), but because Fiat allows politicians to give their voters what they want, that is, what they have voted for.

Voters support endless transfers and ""social expenses"" of all sorts; of the sort, in fact, that were non-existent at the time of the Gold Florin, just because you could not print Gold Florins.

These transfers cost money. Elected politicians finance these expenses with a mixture of straight money printing, deficit-fuelled ""quantitative easing"" (which is ultimately the same, but sounds more sophisticated) and good old tax increases.

You know that it is so by the fact that it is extremely difficult to reduce these transfers, which is a clear sign that they would be political suicide for those who were to promote them. They might target waste and inefficiencies, but they will not target the root cause of the Fiat problem: the fact that such transfers exist.

Now let us imagine a world (which is desired by many here) in which BTC has substituted the USD as currency. Basically, we are back to the Gold Florin: something Government cannot manipulate (then: gold; today: Bitcoin) rules the game. The Government cannot print anything. This means that this Government cannot finance deficit by debasing Fiat.

What would, then, happen? Would the voters miraculously accept that a Government is not allowed to run a deficit? Would they stop to demand transfers of all sorts? Would they stop decrying ""inequalities""? Can you imagine leftist politicians advocating for a balanced budget? Can you imagine lazy or wasteful voters with high time preference embracing the virtues of long-term sacrifice and slow savings accumulation? Hardly.

What would happen is that you would have a mixture of debt and forced confiscation of Bitcoin. You don't want that.

What you want is a Fiat currency that keeps existing and keeps being the way politicians satisfy the wishes of the transfer-angry mob, those who don't know what saving is and have a high time preference.

Meanwhile, you prosper because you keep stacking sats that no government will ever want to confiscate, because it's so much easier to print money instead.",Negative

Inflation is very simply the growth of the money supply, commonly referred to as M2.  

You will never hear that on  Bloomberg, CNBC, FoxBiz, etc as it does not fit the narrative of the advertiser paymasters.  

The chart below I pulled off of St. Louis Fed website and simply had AI calculate the rates for the time period 1980-2025.  Bottom line your investments need to yield 6.7% POST TAX to tread water.  Less than that you are falling behind.  $100K today needs to be $138K by 2030 just to buy the same loaf of bread. 

Do you keep all your money in T-Bills?  HELL NO.  Do you keep it in cash?  HELL NO.  Would you put is all in XYZ Corp Stock?  HELL NO.  Would you put it all in Bitcoin? HELL NO. I might but I am nuts...

So what do you do?  How do you boost your yield but keep your investment safe at the same time?  

There is an answer: add a little bit of Bitcoin.  

By simply adding X% of Bitcoin to your favorite investment you drastically increase your Sharpe Ratio (risk adjusted return). I am not here to tell you how much BTC to add but you need some.

2025-04-22,"MicroStrategy MSTR Stock Misinformation I've seen that most people don‚Äôt actually understand how MicroStrategy works in a lot of these subs.

Been seeing a lot of posts here and elsewhere that treat MicroStrategy like it‚Äôs just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin or a ‚ÄúBitcoin ETF with upside.‚Äù That‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs actually going on when you buy MSTR.

It‚Äôs clear that most people (even bulls) don‚Äôt fully get the engine behind this company.

We asked a CFA charter holder to help us walk through it off the books, just to make sure we weren‚Äôt missing anything. Their perspective helped clarify a lot.

Since 2020, Strategy (that‚Äôs the new name they go by) has been raising capital through common stock, preferred stock, and convertible debt. Not to grow revenue or expand operations but to buy more BTC.

The company is basically converting market optimism and volatility into more Bitcoin on the balance sheet. When investor appetite is strong and the stock is running, they raise. When BTC dips or the market cools, they hold.

It‚Äôs a financial structure designed to accumulate assets over time.

They mostly issue convertible debt. These are bonds that can turn into stock if the price goes high enough.

Because of something called convexity, this structure benefits from volatility. When the stock goes up, the bond gains value faster. When it drops, the bond doesn‚Äôt fall as hard.

Some institutions take advantage of this by doing delta-neutral trades. They buy the bond and short the stock, so they don‚Äôt care where the price goes. They just want movement.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs system actually works better when the stock is volatile.

They created an internal metric called BTC Yield. It tracks how much Bitcoin they‚Äôre adding compared to how much dilution they‚Äôre causing. If BTC Yield is positive, it means they‚Äôre accumulating more BTC per share, even while issuing more stock or debt.

And this is the part I think a lot of people miss. You‚Äôre not buying ‚Äúleveraged Bitcoin‚Äù when you buy MSTR. You‚Äôre buying the¬†*possibility*¬†of future leverage. That only works if they can keep raising money and if BTC keeps rising. If either of those breaks, the premium disappears.

Without volatility, and more directly, new capital, the premium for future leverage will collapse. The question is:¬†*will it happen when Bitcoin is worth $2 trillion, or $200 trillion?*

Strategy is not a pure Bitcoin bet. It‚Äôs a bet on volatility and emotion.

This is not about belief in Bitcoin alone. It‚Äôs about understanding the vehicle you‚Äôre using to gain exposure.

In fact, for many investors, the cleaner and more cost-effective move may be to¬†**simply buy Bitcoin directly**.

We partnered to write a full breakdown of how the model works, not just the Bitcoin angle but the capital structure too. We're not long the stock. Just think people should understand what they‚Äôre actually buying.

2025-04-26,"Bitcoin is the ‚ÄúUltimate Arrow Security‚Äù which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory. Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price itself also signals the market‚Äôs assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it‚Äôs status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

This argument rests on Nobel Prize level economic theory that is now widely accepted among central banks and corporate financiers.

2025-04-26,"5 Common Crypto Mistakes I Wish I Knew When I Started (And How to Avoid Them) Hi r/Cryptomarket

I‚Äôve been navigating the crypto world for 8years, from the 2017 bull run to the latest DeFi trends. Along the way, I‚Äôve made plenty of mistakes‚Äîand seen others make them too. I wanted to share some lessons that might save you time, money, and stress, especially if you‚Äôre new to the space or looking to level up.

5 Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:
1. Falling for Hype (FOMO): Chasing pumps often leads to buying at the top. Tip: Set clear investment goals and stick to a strategy based on fundamentals, not social media hype.
2. Ignoring Security: I once lost funds to a phishing scam‚Äîouch. Tip: Use a hardware wallet, enable 2FA, and double-check URLs before connecting your wallet.
3. Not Doing Enough Research (DYOR): Blindly investing in a ‚Äúhot‚Äù coin is a recipe for disaster. Tip: Check the project‚Äôs whitepaper, team, and GitHub activity. CoinGecko and X posts can be great starting points.
4. Overcomplicating Trading: Leverage and futures can wipe out your portfolio fast. Tip: Start with spot trading and only scale up as you learn.
5. Panic Selling: Market dips are brutal but often temporary. Tip: Zoom out on the charts and focus on long-term trends.

I‚Äôm passionate about helping people navigate crypto safely, whether it‚Äôs setting up a secure wallet, understanding market cycles, or building a balanced portfolio. If you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed or want personalized guidance, feel free to shoot me a DM‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to chat about your goals and share what I‚Äôve learned.

I feel like the original purpose of crypto is fading. It's becoming increasingly centralized and turning into another playground for the ultra-wealthy.

>We are sorry to inform you that your account has been involved in a case of market surveillance, with trading activities identified as collusion, which is classified as market manipulation and is strictly forbidden.

>Our analysis shows that your trading patterns are very similar to other clients, indicating coordinated efforts. Specifically, we have detected multiple clients buy and sell specific cryptocurrencies almost nearly simultaneously. These actions match the definition of collusion and disrupt fair market practices.

>Furthermore, such trading patterns result in sudden price changes leading to large scale liquidation on the platform, which does great harm to Bybit's clients.  
Bybit is committed to protect all clients from malicious losses and ensure a fair and transparent trading environment. Thus, we have implemented trading and withdrawal restrictions on your account, effective immediately.

>We are conducting a thorough investigation. If our investigation determines that you are innocent, we will release these restrictions immediately.

>We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this process. Please contact us if you have any questions or require further clarification.

>With warmest regards,

The thing is ‚Äî I‚Äôm a **single, verified user**, and I‚Äôve often even traded at a loss. Most of my trades are small in size (a few dozen usd mostly 10-20$ with maximal 50-100$). I have no idea how they jumped to ""market manipulation"" from this. I‚Äôm not part of any groups, not coordinating with anyone.

It feels like their system just flagged me without real evidence. And worst of all, they haven't provided any way for me to **prove my innocence** ‚Äî no details, no proof, just locked my funds based on their ""internal investigation.""

This feels incredibly unfair, especially for small users like me. Honestly, it‚Äôs starting to feel like a scam at this point.

Has anyone else faced this? Any advice on what steps I should take next to get back my hard earned money. As far as i know, their ""investigation"" will straight up take forever.

2025-04-22,"MicroStrategy MSTR Stock Misinformation I've seen that most people don‚Äôt actually understand how MicroStrategy works in a lot of these subs.

Been seeing a lot of posts here and elsewhere that treat MicroStrategy like it‚Äôs just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin or a ‚ÄúBitcoin ETF with upside.‚Äù That‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs actually going on when you buy MSTR.

It‚Äôs clear that most people (even bulls) don‚Äôt fully get the engine behind this company.

We asked a CFA charter holder to help us walk through it off the books, just to make sure we weren‚Äôt missing anything. Their perspective helped clarify a lot.

Since 2020, Strategy (that‚Äôs the new name they go by) has been raising capital through common stock, preferred stock, and convertible debt. Not to grow revenue or expand operations but to buy more BTC.

The company is basically converting market optimism and volatility into more Bitcoin on the balance sheet. When investor appetite is strong and the stock is running, they raise. When BTC dips or the market cools, they hold.

It‚Äôs a financial structure designed to accumulate assets over time.

They mostly issue convertible debt. These are bonds that can turn into stock if the price goes high enough.

Because of something called convexity, this structure benefits from volatility. When the stock goes up, the bond gains value faster. When it drops, the bond doesn‚Äôt fall as hard.

Some institutions take advantage of this by doing delta-neutral trades. They buy the bond and short the stock, so they don‚Äôt care where the price goes. They just want movement.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs system actually works better when the stock is volatile.

They created an internal metric called BTC Yield. It tracks how much Bitcoin they‚Äôre adding compared to how much dilution they‚Äôre causing. If BTC Yield is positive, it means they‚Äôre accumulating more BTC per share, even while issuing more stock or debt.

And this is the part I think a lot of people miss. You‚Äôre not buying ‚Äúleveraged Bitcoin‚Äù when you buy MSTR. You‚Äôre buying the¬†*possibility*¬†of future leverage. That only works if they can keep raising money and if BTC keeps rising. If either of those breaks, the premium disappears.

Without volatility, and more directly, new capital, the premium for future leverage will collapse. The question is:¬†*will it happen when Bitcoin is worth $2 trillion, or $200 trillion?*

Strategy is not a pure Bitcoin bet. It‚Äôs a bet on volatility and emotion.

This is not about belief in Bitcoin alone. It‚Äôs about understanding the vehicle you‚Äôre using to gain exposure.

In fact, for many investors, the cleaner and more cost-effective move may be to¬†**simply buy Bitcoin directly**.

We partnered to write a full breakdown of how the model works, not just the Bitcoin angle but the capital structure too. We're not long the stock. Just think people should understand what they‚Äôre actually buying.

So what is this gold mine Im referring to?
The Story:

Im not great at programming but Im great at forming logic trees, just not programming them myself(hallelujah for being ever so slightly autistic and having the occassional ADD hyper focus episodes)

I dont know much about crypto, or trading in general, but i know you can make good money at it.

What I have learned Im pretty dang good at, is giving prompts to AI...

I think maybe some of you are already putting the pieces together, but ill explain for those who dont understand yet. Exploring AI's capabilities with a curiousity how language models could help me make money using their skills, I got locked in on about 20hours of work with a large language model, and managed to get it to output me a working python script to trade crypto for me, using its knowledge of market and coin indicators  my bot is currently in demo mode, using the actual trade logic + real time data from my exchange(kraken) to execute batches of 1 to 3 trades every few minutes. I am currently on my 3rd version of the bot(i started this journey late friday night) and at the moment the bot is simulating the trades using the actual logic and live data, just no real money in the game yet until I am 100% satisfied with the functioning. 

That said I wanna share the results of my first tests of this version

Test 1: 10am to 10:18am -simulated starting fund 300euros - results - 693.74 cents 230% profit in 18 minutes

Test 2: 4:29pm to 4:51 pm - simulated starting fund 300 euros - results - 663.23 euros 220% profit in 22minutes.

A few minor tweaks to be implemented before running 3rd test, but the bot is designed to scale with amount of funds available and to reinvest profits.

I hear right now is a bearish market and Im excited to finish fine tuning, go live with my trades for real money, and to see in the future how the results look during a strong bull market.

Will edit and update after next test to let you know how my adventure is playing out, let me know what you think of my results. 

Lastly iam not and will not be willing to share this bot, or take money from others, I just wonder how these results stack up against the metrics of human traders and also would love for anyone with experience to share how they approach trading cryptos so i might be able to improve my bots logic and performance.

The fact the Russian economy is in genuine peril is not just idle speculation on my part. The Russian economy is headed for the abyss. Currently every industry needs to be artificially propped up by the government because the war effort is burning up so much resources.

Is it too naive to believe I could still make a profit by jumping in after seeing such a big short-term pump?

Open a Trust Wallet

Use a DEX to buy the coin

Possibly transfer it to Binance or another exchange later

Is this how people actually find early opportunities, or is it just gambling?

2025-04-26,"Bitcoin is the ‚ÄúUltimate Arrow Security‚Äù which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory. Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price itself also signals the market‚Äôs assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it‚Äôs status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

This argument rests on Nobel Prize level economic theory that is now widely accepted among central banks and corporate financiers.

2025-04-22,"MicroStrategy MSTR Stock Misinformation I've seen that most people don‚Äôt actually understand how MicroStrategy works in a lot of these subs.

Been seeing a lot of posts here and elsewhere that treat MicroStrategy like it‚Äôs just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin or a ‚ÄúBitcoin ETF with upside.‚Äù That‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs actually going on when you buy MSTR.

It‚Äôs clear that most people (even bulls) don‚Äôt fully get the engine behind this company.

We asked a CFA charter holder to help us walk through it off the books, just to make sure we weren‚Äôt missing anything. Their perspective helped clarify a lot.

Since 2020, Strategy (that‚Äôs the new name they go by) has been raising capital through common stock, preferred stock, and convertible debt. Not to grow revenue or expand operations but to buy more BTC.

The company is basically converting market optimism and volatility into more Bitcoin on the balance sheet. When investor appetite is strong and the stock is running, they raise. When BTC dips or the market cools, they hold.

It‚Äôs a financial structure designed to accumulate assets over time.

They mostly issue convertible debt. These are bonds that can turn into stock if the price goes high enough.

Because of something called convexity, this structure benefits from volatility. When the stock goes up, the bond gains value faster. When it drops, the bond doesn‚Äôt fall as hard.

Some institutions take advantage of this by doing delta-neutral trades. They buy the bond and short the stock, so they don‚Äôt care where the price goes. They just want movement.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs system actually works better when the stock is volatile.

They created an internal metric called BTC Yield. It tracks how much Bitcoin they‚Äôre adding compared to how much dilution they‚Äôre causing. If BTC Yield is positive, it means they‚Äôre accumulating more BTC per share, even while issuing more stock or debt.

And this is the part I think a lot of people miss. You‚Äôre not buying ‚Äúleveraged Bitcoin‚Äù when you buy MSTR. You‚Äôre buying the¬†*possibility*¬†of future leverage. That only works if they can keep raising money and if BTC keeps rising. If either of those breaks, the premium disappears.

Without volatility, and more directly, new capital, the premium for future leverage will collapse. The question is:¬†*will it happen when Bitcoin is worth $2 trillion, or $200 trillion?*

Strategy is not a pure Bitcoin bet. It‚Äôs a bet on volatility and emotion.

This is not about belief in Bitcoin alone. It‚Äôs about understanding the vehicle you‚Äôre using to gain exposure.

In fact, for many investors, the cleaner and more cost-effective move may be to¬†**simply buy Bitcoin directly**.

We partnered to write a full breakdown of how the model works, not just the Bitcoin angle but the capital structure too. We're not long the stock. Just think people should understand what they‚Äôre actually buying.

2025-04-21,"Fed rate cut expectations may drive Bitcoin higher faster? Today saw an interesting analysis that said BTC has risen more than 33% since April, despite the global trade war heating up and market sentiment fluctuating. With the halving approaching, rate cuts in the pipeline, and institutions like Strategy and Tether continuing to enter the market, there's actually a lot of upside.

However, analysts also said that the market is now rising, but the ‚Äúwait-and-see mood‚Äù is very obvious - we are afraid to enter too early, chasing the high set, but also afraid of missing the big opportunity, the feeling is waiting for a clearer signal. In particular, the Federal Reserve May/June interest rate cut or not, has become a key reference anchor.

I am currently more concerned about the performance of the mining direction. For example, $CANG (NASDAQ:CANG), which mined 530 BTC in March, has a position of almost 2,500, and has a steady, global style (US, Canada, Ethiopia, Oman...), and has been included in the Bitcoin Standard ETF (OWNB) by Bitwise.

2025-04-26,"Bitcoin is the ‚ÄúUltimate Arrow Security‚Äù which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory. Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price itself also signals the market‚Äôs assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it‚Äôs status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

This argument rests on Nobel Prize level economic theory that is now widely accepted among central banks and corporate financiers.

2025-04-20,"85+ out of 100 people you can ask in BTC do NOT run their own node According to Bitcoin ownership numbers put out by Dan Morehead, of Pantera Capital, not long ago, we can work out that at most 15 / 100 BTC users are self-custodial.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1h0nwvh/btcers_owning_coins_proportion_of_selfcustody_vs/

The numbers who hold their own keys / coins self-custodially is strictly larger than the number of people who run nodes.

Why is that?

Because you can hold your keys/coins without even running a node. You can use a light wallet (SPV), or even just hold your own bitcoin on a paper wallet (written record of the key / seed phrase).

So there are even fewer than 15% who run their own nodes. Likely way fewer.

Just bear this in mind when you hear BTC people talk about how everyone should be running their own node etc.

That's bunk, and has almost always been bunk. Satoshi didn't design the system in a way that requires everyone to their own node. The BTC crowd doesn't do this either. The people claiming you need to, belong to a very small part of the user group.

Where things can get off track is when you let the proclaimed needs of a very small minority dictate the properties of the system that is supposed to be usable by all its users. The best check on preventing the majority being exploited by the minority, is for the majority to check, frequently, whether the system still performs well for their purposes.

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

2025-04-24,"A very bitcoin auction... just don't blink. An auction is a set of rules or procedures to accomplish three things simultaneously. Those things are:

1. Price discovery: determining the fair market price. 
2. Transfer the title of ownership. 
3. Determine the buyer, or who will be paying the seller. 

There's a group of people, the bidders, who know the auction rules to participate to fulfill their economic needs. There can be different rules for different types of things. 

There are FOUR common problems that can result from a typical auction: 

- Buyers not paying, 
- Buyers not picking up,
- Seller not getting paid because buyers didn't pay, 
- And finally, sellers not collecting unsold property. 

But since Bitcoin Cash has a very capable scripting system, we could have a perfect auction that accomplished the three functions needed and prevented the four property/payment problems perfectly. 

With CashTokens, what we need is one transaction that remits payment to the seller, and releases the token for the buyer, while allowing anyone to bid at any price. 

Auctions take time. Bidders need to know that something will be sold, & about when. Bidders need to research authenticity, the current market and plan their overall strategy.  

In a Dutch Auction, a successively lower ASK is called until someone bids. The first and only bidder wins the lot. 

A Dutch auction may sometimes transition into an English auction. In an English auction, the ASK goes up in regular increments with successive bids from different parties until no one wants to bid higher and an auctioneer says ""sold"". 

So to do an English auction in bitcoin, we'd need to keep track the current high bidder, their bid and (since we can't put that info on the NFT being sold), we'd need some way to link or refer a bid to the token utxo. 

In a bitcoin virtual machine, there is no global state like with an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). While it's possible to write an [English-like auction system](https://github.com/BitCANN/contracts/blob/main/README.md) with CashTokens, a Dutch auction is much more straight-forward because it can be done in one transaction with no need to keep track of the bid, bidder, or link to the lot being sold. 

Again, the rules for a Dutch Auction are:

- Start at some very high price.
- Go down in regular increments.
- The first bid wins. 

Dutch auctions are great at getting things sold‚Äïthey're great for throughput. 

If we use the same ridiculous price (maybe 50 BCH) for every lot, then the only state we need to keep track of is time, which is already available on every bitcoin output since 2017. 

So what do we need to say in bitcoin to make this auction happen? What does the auction contract need to check? 

- An output MUST be a version 2 transaction (for timelocks).
- The output value MUST must be higher than the ASK. 
- An output MUST pay the seller the current ASK. 
- If using block height as time, we need some checks for that.

We don't care where the buyer sends their new token, that's unrestricted, or restricted by consensus rules already. 

To list tokens for sale, a seller could send their tokens to a contract where the ASK is always 50 BCH divided by the age of the unspent output in blocks, and anyone would be able to create a transaction spending their tokens and paying the seller the fair market price for their token.  

The above logic in CashScript (// BitcoinScript): 

    contract DutchAuction(

      // Opening ASK 
      int open,

      // LockingBytecode of the consigner, the address receiving payout
      bytes recipientLockingBytecode

    ) {

      // 
      function buy() {
           
        // Require version 2 for BIP68 support
        // OP_TXVERSION OP_2 OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY 
        require(tx.version == 2, ""must use v2 transaction""); 

        // The minimum relative age is the opening bid divided by the ask.
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTVALUE OP_DIV 
        int requiredAge = open/tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].value;

        // The age in blocks must be in a valid BIP68 range
        // ffff00 OP_OVER OP_GREATERTHAN OP_VERIFY 
        require(65535 > requiredAge, ""open over value (required age) must be less than 65535"");   

        // Enforce the minimum age. 
        // OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP 
        require(this.age >= requiredAge, ""bid too low"");

        // Check that each output sends to the consignor
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUAL
        require(tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].lockingBytecode == recipientLockingBytecode, ""must payout consigner"");
        
      } 

    }

The above code works out to 26 bytes for the auction logic on the blockchain. 

It looks like this:

    c2529c69007ac0cc9603ffff005179a069007ab275c0cd517a87

With the balance of the auction contract, showing the age of the lots, no special service is needed to calculate the ASK. It's decentralized, use your own computer.

After 1 block the ASK is 50 BCH. After 10 blocks the ASK would be 5 BCH. After a week (~1000 blocks) the price would be 0.05. After a month the price would be 1.25M sats. After a year the price would be 76k sats, which would be about as low as it goes. 

There's a lot of stuff left out: 

- no commission
- no premiums 
- no auctioneers
- no volley of bidders
- no cancellations 
- no welching
- no unsold property (of value above 76k sats) 

Bidders would have to pay standard transaction fees to miners. 

But sellers don't get a free ride. Sellers that no longer wished to auction their property could cancel by buying their lots back. They pay by expressing what price they believe is too low, just like everyone else. They'd have to pay themselves the current ASK, and pay miners a fee for doing so. 

It would be easy for a seller to list 10 NFTs (or 1000) using a single contract address. The seller's auction contract is just a token-aware bitcoin cash address. They could send tokens to it from any wallet with support for sending to such a CashToken aware address. 

The auction contract is designed for arbitrage. A transaction could be built simultaneously buying purchasing a fungible token at auction while swapping the same token out for Bitcoin Cash on a compatible dex like cauldron. 

The parameters to find an auction contract on-chain are just the start price and the seller's address. That data would fit in an the size of NFT commitment. So sellers could announce that they were having an auction, [if/when we had a CashToken powered social dapp for that.](https://fundme.cash/campaign/28)

***

2025-04-24,"Bond Market Blues I. The Starting Point: Cracks in the Old System

We‚Äôre already here.
	‚Ä¢	Sovereign debt is unpayable: U.S., Japan, EU, China‚Äîall buried in debt with no path to repayment.
	‚Ä¢	Central banks are trapped: Raise rates? Trigger defaults. Cut rates? Fuel inflation.
	‚Ä¢	Trust is eroding: Bond yields rise, currencies wobble, and capital starts fleeing ‚Äúsafe‚Äù assets.

Key stress point: The bond market begins to smell smoke. Foreign buyers (like China or Japan) stop buying Treasuries. The Fed quietly becomes the buyer of last resort again.

‚∏ª

II. The Liquidity Trap Meets Fiscal Dominance
	‚Ä¢	Rates rise, and the cost of debt explodes. U.S. interest payments hit $1.5 trillion/year.
	‚Ä¢	Treasury auctions begin to fail. Investors demand higher yields to roll debt.
	‚Ä¢	The Fed is forced into stealth yield curve control‚Äîbuying longer-term debt to suppress rates.

This is the moment the mask slips.
Markets realize: the Fed is no longer targeting inflation. It‚Äôs targeting solvency.

‚∏ª

III. Inflation Reignites, Faith Breaks
	‚Ä¢	Suppressed yields and unchecked spending light a second wave of inflation.
	‚Ä¢	Savers are slaughtered by negative real rates.
	‚Ä¢	Financial repression begins: capital controls, mandatory bond purchases, limits on cash or crypto use.

But capital is fluid, and trust is faster than law. Money leaks out‚Äîinto gold, hard assets, offshore accounts‚Äîand increasingly, Bitcoin.

‚∏ª

IV. The Flippening (of Trust)

This is not a technological shift. It‚Äôs a trust migration.
	‚Ä¢	Nation-states lose the narrative. ‚ÄúRisk-free‚Äù becomes a joke.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin is no longer seen as speculative‚Äîit‚Äôs seen as a hedge against sovereign failure.
	‚Ä¢	Nations with weak currencies begin to adopt Bitcoin openly (already happening with El Salvador).
	‚Ä¢	Corporates start holding it on balance sheets‚Äînot to get rich, but to survive devaluation.

Some early governments fight it‚Äîbanning self-custody, labeling it dangerous, taxing it to death. Others embrace it‚Äîgaining early access to the next financial layer.

‚∏ª

V. The New Market Infrastructure Emerges

As trust deepens:
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin lending markets mature: Lenders issue loans backed by overcollateralized BTC.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin-denominated bonds are issued‚Äîeither directly (El Salvador-style), or via DeFi protocols.
	‚Ä¢	Sovereigns who can‚Äôt borrow in fiat anymore start to float Bitcoin-backed debt‚Äîjust to get access to real capital.
	‚Ä¢	Layer 2 systems (Lightning, Fedimint, Ark, etc.) enable payment rails and banking functions.

A new monetary ecosystem grows‚Äîparallel to the old one‚Äîbut faster, smaller, and harder.

‚∏ª

VI. The Collapse Phase of the Old Guard

Eventually, the debt burden breaks the fiat system:
	‚Ä¢	Central banks lose control of inflation and can no longer contain bond yields.
	‚Ä¢	A default or restructuring hits a major economy (Japan? Italy? U.S.?)
	‚Ä¢	The dollar survives‚Äîbut not as king. A multi-polar system forms: USD, CNY, and BTC.

In this world:
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin is the reserve of last resort.
	‚Ä¢	Fiat is still used, but it‚Äôs anchored, not absolute.
	‚Ä¢	Credit exists, but it‚Äôs hard-won, expensive, and honest.

‚∏ª

VII. Life After the Transition: Scarcity Reinstated
	‚Ä¢	Governments shrink. They can no longer print to fund endless wars, bloated bureaucracies, or financial bailouts.
	‚Ä¢	Savings are meaningful. Time preference drops. Capital investment improves.
	‚Ä¢	Credit is available, but collateralized and market-priced.
	‚Ä¢	The financial system becomes more stable, but less forgiving.

And Bitcoin?
It isn‚Äôt a replacement for government. It‚Äôs a neutral monetary foundation‚Äîlike gravity. Everyone must build on top of it honestly, or fail.

‚∏ª

Final Image:

Picture a future where:
	‚Ä¢	Treasury bonds are relics.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin yields set the global floor for risk-free return.
	‚Ä¢	Countries are rated by how credibly they can borrow real money.
	‚Ä¢	And the market, not the central bank, holds the true power.",Negative

2025-04-24,"A very bitcoin auction... just don't blink. An auction is a set of rules or procedures to accomplish three things simultaneously. Those things are:

1. Price discovery: determining the fair market price. 
2. Transfer the title of ownership. 
3. Determine the buyer, or who will be paying the seller. 

There's a group of people, the bidders, who know the auction rules to participate to fulfill their economic needs. There can be different rules for different types of things. 

There are FOUR common problems that can result from a typical auction: 

- Buyers not paying, 
- Buyers not picking up,
- Seller not getting paid because buyers didn't pay, 
- And finally, sellers not collecting unsold property. 

But since Bitcoin Cash has a very capable scripting system, we could have a perfect auction that accomplished the three functions needed and prevented the four property/payment problems perfectly. 

With CashTokens, what we need is one transaction that remits payment to the seller, and releases the token for the buyer, while allowing anyone to bid at any price. 

Auctions take time. Bidders need to know that something will be sold, & about when. Bidders need to research authenticity, the current market and plan their overall strategy.  

In a Dutch Auction, a successively lower ASK is called until someone bids. The first and only bidder wins the lot. 

A Dutch auction may sometimes transition into an English auction. In an English auction, the ASK goes up in regular increments with successive bids from different parties until no one wants to bid higher and an auctioneer says ""sold"". 

So to do an English auction in bitcoin, we'd need to keep track the current high bidder, their bid and (since we can't put that info on the NFT being sold), we'd need some way to link or refer a bid to the token utxo. 

In a bitcoin virtual machine, there is no global state like with an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). While it's possible to write an [English-like auction system](https://github.com/BitCANN/contracts/blob/main/README.md) with CashTokens, a Dutch auction is much more straight-forward because it can be done in one transaction with no need to keep track of the bid, bidder, or link to the lot being sold. 

Again, the rules for a Dutch Auction are:

- Start at some very high price.
- Go down in regular increments.
- The first bid wins. 

Dutch auctions are great at getting things sold‚Äïthey're great for throughput. 

If we use the same ridiculous price (maybe 50 BCH) for every lot, then the only state we need to keep track of is time, which is already available on every bitcoin output since 2017. 

So what do we need to say in bitcoin to make this auction happen? What does the auction contract need to check? 

- An output MUST be a version 2 transaction (for timelocks).
- The output value MUST must be higher than the ASK. 
- An output MUST pay the seller the current ASK. 
- If using block height as time, we need some checks for that.

We don't care where the buyer sends their new token, that's unrestricted, or restricted by consensus rules already. 

To list tokens for sale, a seller could send their tokens to a contract where the ASK is always 50 BCH divided by the age of the unspent output in blocks, and anyone would be able to create a transaction spending their tokens and paying the seller the fair market price for their token.  

The above logic in CashScript (// BitcoinScript): 

    contract DutchAuction(

      // Opening ASK 
      int open,

      // LockingBytecode of the consigner, the address receiving payout
      bytes recipientLockingBytecode

    ) {

      // 
      function buy() {
           
        // Require version 2 for BIP68 support
        // OP_TXVERSION OP_2 OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY 
        require(tx.version == 2, ""must use v2 transaction""); 

        // The minimum relative age is the opening bid divided by the ask.
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTVALUE OP_DIV 
        int requiredAge = open/tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].value;

        // The age in blocks must be in a valid BIP68 range
        // ffff00 OP_OVER OP_GREATERTHAN OP_VERIFY 
        require(65535 > requiredAge, ""open over value (required age) must be less than 65535"");   

        // Enforce the minimum age. 
        // OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP 
        require(this.age >= requiredAge, ""bid too low"");

        // Check that each output sends to the consignor
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUAL
        require(tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].lockingBytecode == recipientLockingBytecode, ""must payout consigner"");
        
      } 

    }

The above code works out to 26 bytes for the auction logic on the blockchain. 

It looks like this:

    c2529c69007ac0cc9603ffff005179a069007ab275c0cd517a87

With the balance of the auction contract, showing the age of the lots, no special service is needed to calculate the ASK. It's decentralized, use your own computer.

After 1 block the ASK is 50 BCH. After 10 blocks the ASK would be 5 BCH. After a week (~1000 blocks) the price would be 0.05. After a month the price would be 1.25M sats. After a year the price would be 76k sats, which would be about as low as it goes. 

There's a lot of stuff left out: 

- no commission
- no premiums 
- no auctioneers
- no volley of bidders
- no cancellations 
- no welching
- no unsold property (of value above 76k sats) 

Bidders would have to pay standard transaction fees to miners. 

But sellers don't get a free ride. Sellers that no longer wished to auction their property could cancel by buying their lots back. They pay by expressing what price they believe is too low, just like everyone else. They'd have to pay themselves the current ASK, and pay miners a fee for doing so. 

It would be easy for a seller to list 10 NFTs (or 1000) using a single contract address. The seller's auction contract is just a token-aware bitcoin cash address. They could send tokens to it from any wallet with support for sending to such a CashToken aware address. 

The auction contract is designed for arbitrage. A transaction could be built simultaneously buying purchasing a fungible token at auction while swapping the same token out for Bitcoin Cash on a compatible dex like cauldron. 

The parameters to find an auction contract on-chain are just the start price and the seller's address. That data would fit in an the size of NFT commitment. So sellers could announce that they were having an auction, [if/when we had a CashToken powered social dapp for that.](https://fundme.cash/campaign/28)

The auction contract requires that each output pay for a lot on a corresponding input, so many lots (of the same age) could be purchased simultaneously in a single transaction. An app could include a function to close the auction by buying every lot in a single transaction.",Neutral

2025-04-20,"85+ out of 100 people you can ask in BTC do NOT run their own node According to Bitcoin ownership numbers put out by Dan Morehead, of Pantera Capital, not long ago, we can work out that at most 15 / 100 BTC users are self-custodial.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1h0nwvh/btcers_owning_coins_proportion_of_selfcustody_vs/

The numbers who hold their own keys / coins self-custodially is strictly larger than the number of people who run nodes.

Why is that?

Because you can hold your keys/coins without even running a node. You can use a light wallet (SPV), or even just hold your own bitcoin on a paper wallet (written record of the key / seed phrase).

So there are even fewer than 15% who run their own nodes. Likely way fewer.

Just bear this in mind when you hear BTC people talk about how everyone should be running their own node etc.

That's bunk, and has almost always been bunk. Satoshi didn't design the system in a way that requires everyone to their own node. The BTC crowd doesn't do this either. The people claiming you need to, belong to a very small part of the user group.

Where things can get off track is when you let the proclaimed needs of a very small minority dictate the properties of the system that is supposed to be usable by all its users. The best check on preventing the majority being exploited by the minority, is for the majority to check, frequently, whether the system still performs well for their purposes.

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

- Lets say I have 3 UXTO account 

1 btc 

2 btc 

2.5 btc 

If I wanna send 3.5 BTC is there a way to pick the 2.5 and 1 btc UXTO accounts to reduce total fees instead of having to take from all three and having a leftover account made? 

- I use a cex and have a cold storage wallet I send everything to, I would like to set up an auto DCA of 200 - 300 monthly and then send it straight to the cold wallet to forget about. But from what I'm reading this seems like not the best idea, over many months I will have tons of UXTO accounts and the transaction cost will be massive down the road when it's time to move it - is 200 / 300 enough to not really worry about UXTO or should I just build up 1000 bucks and send it then to reduce fees. 

- lets say I have 1 btc in my address in 10 separate .1 UXTO accounts. Can I send the 1 btc to myself and pay the fees to create 1 UXTO account? Is that even possible and if yes would it even be worth doing? Would it be a good idea to wait till network usage is low to get the lowest rate on fees?

Because I do not intend to ever buy anything with BTC and the only thing I do is to stack sats on my cold wallet, I am happy to proceed in this way, as it also makes it easier and eliminates error. 

Now: 

1. Is this ""receiver address"" a unique identifier for my wallet (which means: if I want to send sats to \*that\* wallet I will have to use \*that\* address?) or is it something that Kraken only writes automatically out of convenience, and I could be able to create a \*new\* address that sends money to that very same wallet, without it automatically creating a second, third, fourth ""passphrase"" wallet when I use a second, third, fourth receiver's address? 

2. If I can create a new receiver address but send the money to the same Passphrase wallet, what is the advantage of doing that? And is such an advantage exists, why does Kraken encourage me not to use it by repeating the last address I have used?

1. Optimized for Stablecoin Swaps
Saber specializes in low-slippage swaps between stablecoins and wrapped assets, such as USDC, USDT, renBTC, and Marinade SOL. This focus ensures efficient trading with minimal price deviation, even for larger transactions.

Liquidity providers (LPs) can earn substantial annual percentage yields (APYs) by staking in Saber‚Äôs liquidity pools. As of early 2025, yields up to 64% have been reported, with popular pools like USDT-USDC offering around 27%. These rewards are distributed in SBR tokens, which also function as governance tokens. 

3. Governance and Community Participation
SBR token holders have governance rights, allowing them to vote on protocol changes and liquidity incentives. This decentralized approach aligns the interests of users, developers, and ecosystem partners.

4. Seamless Cross-Chain Interoperability
Saber integrates with cross-chain bridges like Wormhole and Allbridge, facilitating the exchange of wrapped assets from other blockchains, such as Ethereum, within the Solana ecosystem. This interoperability enhances liquidity and asset management across chains. 

5. Built on Solana‚Äôs High-Performance Blockchain
Leveraging Solana's capabilities, Saber offers fast transaction processing and low fees, making it a cost-effective platform for DeFi activities. This infrastructure supports high throughput and low latency, ensuring efficient trading experiences.

That‚Äôs why $Tired is backed by the Tired Dad Foundation (TDF), a legit registered Inc ready to bring real-world branding to Web3.

Why?

‚Üí They sent me a wallet address that didn‚Äôt validate in my wallet

‚Üí We didn‚Äôt know which chain to use

‚Üí We had to calculate the fiat-to-crypto value manually

‚Üí I wasn‚Äôt even sure if the funds landed in the right place

It was a mess. So we built **Nimbe** \- a tool that makes getting paid in crypto feel like sharing a PayPal link.

# What Nimbe Does

* Lets anyone create a clean, short crypto payment link in seconds
* Works with USDC (for now), no login or app needed
* Handles amount conversion + wallet destination behind the scenes
* Links expire, are chain-validated, and remove confusion for the payer

# Why it might moon:

* It‚Äôs not a coin - it‚Äôs a utility layer
* There are **millions of freelancers and creators** who want to accept crypto but hate explaining it to clients
* Crypto payments are stuck in 2015 UX-wise ‚Äî this solves that
* Stripe for fiat. Nimbe could become Stripe for crypto.

We‚Äôre super early (MVP is live).

No fluff.

2025-04-24,"Bullish NEW tokenomics for OG infra project POKT: new burn, new utility, end to new inflation. READ THE THESIS! I‚Äôve been in crypto since 2017. In the Solana trenches, Ethereum alts back pre-2020s, bet big on DeFi in the era when APYs were too long for mobile screen sizes.

Through this time, there‚Äôs been an OG infra company doing RPC - and now open data - that‚Äôs been around. It wasn‚Äôt always a good token (crazy inflation back in the day) - but I‚Äôve been tracking them for a few yrs and IMO there‚Äôs a big reason to be bullish.

**TLDR: I‚Äôm bullish on Pocket Network ($POKT), and here‚Äôs why you should be too.**

Main point: they‚Äôre about to launch the Shannon update which will totally rework the tokenomics, add a new line of business, and most importantly: KILL inflation/new issuance, while **introducing token burn tied to usage**. That last bit is important: *Pocket clears +500m RPC calls every damn day,* so we‚Äôre looking at a formerly *inflationary* asset *that‚Äôs now* ***deflationary****.*

# 1. Best Price/Performance for RPC: Pocket‚Äôs Web3 Infrastructure Edge

With the Shannon upgrade, POKT becomes the **lowest-cost RPC provider** in the Web3 space. That‚Äôs vs Alchemy, Infura, Quiknode - all of them. They‚Äôre not necessarily the best for everything, but they‚Äôre about to be the cheapest - **up to 75% cheaper competition**. dApps NEED RPC infra to exist, and Pocket‚Äôs going to be the go-to solution. They already make up a double-digit % of Alchemy‚Äôs RPC supply. They‚Äôre eating the market and no one knows about it.

# 2. Token Inflation? Gone. Burn Mechanism + DAO-Controlled Supply

Forget inflation. With **burn-to-use** tokenomics, every relay burns POKT, driving **deflation** and linking supply directly to usage. Plus, only the **DAO** can mint new tokens, ensuring supply remains in check and tied to actual network demand. It‚Äôs an EIP-1559-style burn mechanic but with a **use-case-driven** twist.

# 3. Expanding into AI & Open Data: POKT Powers LLM training on decentralized data

Pocket‚Äôs **open data** play is pretty interesting. The network will now serve **AI inference** traffic and fuel LLMs (think LLaMa & DeepSeek training), with a supply side of on and off-chain data providers serving the growing demand of AI builders. This AI boom makes data a premium asset. Payment? All in POKT. The **total addressable market** (TAM) just went **way up**, and usage = burn.

# TL;DR: Pocket ($POKT) is Positioned to Pop for Growth

1. **Best price/performance on RPC**: Newly cheapest, most decentralized, censorship-desistant, must-have Web3 infra.  
2. **From inflationary to deflationary asset:** Deflationary loop tied to real-world usage (AKA a ‚Äúbusiness model‚Äù for you non-crypto peeps) = sustainable value  
3. **AI & Data Expansion**: New line of business = new line of burn

POKT is looking solid as a long-term bet with utility-driven tokenomics & real fundamentals. A revenue-generating business model even, but don‚Äôt wanna scare anyone away.

**Network launch is mid-May, so smart money (and me) are loading up prior.** There was already a $2mm volume day this week, so folks are sniffing this out. Get your back, diamond hand through launch and deflation, ???, retire.

Each collection will explore different themes, giving everyone a chance to own a piece of his legendary style. Personally? I‚Äôm counting the days till I can mint mine. 

As always, this is just a glimpse of what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes. We‚Äôre constantly building ‚Äî forging partnerships, creating new content, and getting $LOOBY ready for its moment when the market wakes up.

**Why just HODL when you can predict, create, and earn‚Äîall at once?**

Step into the future of crypto with a twist of comedy, a dash of AI, and a whole lot of community energy.

Let‚Äôs be real. In crypto, the house always wins. But what if you could be the house?

That‚Äôs exactly what MoneyGlitch.fun makes possible.

We‚Äôve built the first true rewards token launchpad on Solana. A platform where anyone can launch their own token in under 5 minutes. No coding required. Just choose a name, upload a logo, decide how to reward your holders, and you‚Äôre live on Raydium. No bonding curves. No hidden mechanics. Just simple, fair, and tradeable launches.

When creating your token, you set the rules. You choose the tax percentage, how often rewards are distributed, and whether that tax goes to holders, burns the supply, or a combination of both. Everything is fully customizable, and the reward system is completely handled by MoneyGlitch. That means creators and community leaders can focus on growth and community, without having to worry about any of the technical infrastructure.

It‚Äôs like running slot machines, except you built them, and people are playing 24/7. And it‚Äôs all on-chain.

MoneyGlitch.fun is live now. So is the native $GLITCH token, which rewards holders in SOL every 5 minutes. The team‚Äôs previous project reached just under a $30 million market cap and is still going strong after over a year. This new platform is built to last, and the opportunity to be early is wide open.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to own a casino, now‚Äôs your chance.

So what does it take to build a solid community?



It takes a good relatable narrative, a good dev and team, transparency, and clear visions for the future. Without these four key things, a project will die quicker than it was minted.

They‚Äôre the type to act first and speak later, rather than being built on hype.

We‚Äôre so early it‚Äôs ridiculous.

MoneyGlitchFun is already live, and it‚Äôs doing something no one else in the Solana space has pulled off yet it‚Äôs a fully working, no-code launchpad for rewards tokens. That means anyone can create their own token in just a few clicks. You choose the name, upload an image, set your tax settings, select how you want to reward your holders (burn, distribute, etc.), and boom you‚Äôre live on Raydium instantly. No bonding curves. No nonsense.

This is plug-and-play token creation, built for the new wave of Solana degens who want to move fast and reward their communities in a real way.

Imagine the power this gives to creators, meme coin lovers, small communities, or even serious projects that want to experiment with new tokenomics. It lowers the barrier to entry completely and gives you a polished token profile with everything you need links, info, stats, tax settings  all in one place.

And that‚Äôs just the platform.

Now here‚Äôs where it gets even crazier: the native token $GLITCH rewards you in SOL every 5 minutes. No joke. You buy it, you hold it, and you start seeing SOL hit your wallet automatically every few minutes. It‚Äôs powered by a simple 5% tax, and the system just works.

We‚Äôre talking about a live product, a long-term vision, and a native token that actually rewards you in one of the most valuable coins in the entire ecosystem of Solana.

This isn‚Äôt a concept ,this is live.

2025-04-21,"$IMG ‚Äì A Solana Token-2022 project Let‚Äôs skip the fluff.

Most coins on this sub drop buzzwords like ‚Äúutility,‚Äù ‚Äúpassive income,‚Äù or ‚Äúmoonshot,‚Äù but rarely deliver anything beyond vibes and charts. I‚Äôve been watching $IMG (Infinite Money Glitch) for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs one of the very few that‚Äôs actually doing what it says ‚Äì quietly, consistently, and verifiably on-chain.

‚∏ª

The Core Mechanism:
	
‚Ä¢ Built on Solana‚Äôs Token-2022 standard ‚Äì a new upgrade over SPL tokens.
	
‚Ä¢ Every transaction has a 5% fee ‚Äì locked and immutable via smart contract.
	
‚Ä¢ That fee is collected in SOL, then automatically distributed every 5 minutes to all holders.
	
‚Ä¢ No staking. No claiming. No interface required.
	
‚Ä¢ SOL just appears in your wallet ‚Äì passively.

Solana doesn‚Äôt support native schedulers (like Ethereum Keep3r), so a script triggers the distribution, but the logic itself is fully on-chain. Anyone familiar with Token-2022 knows how powerful that is.

‚∏ª

On-Chain Protections:

Unlike shady projects that rug within days, $IMG baked trust directly into the contract:
	
‚Ä¢ TransferFeeConfigAuthority: NULL ‚Äì can‚Äôt change tax or ownership.

‚Ä¢ WithdrawWithheldAuthority is transparent ‚Äì everyone sees the wallet that pays you.
	
‚Ä¢ No team tokens. No presale. No VC. No insider allocations.
	
‚Ä¢ Token supply is capped and fixed from day 1.
	
‚Ä¢ Verified on Solscan, Jupiter Aggregator, and Stocktwits.
	
‚Ä¢ Rewards are in SOL ‚Äì not another inflationary token.

‚∏ª

Community-Driven Growth:
	
‚Ä¢ 27,000+ holders in under 2 months.
	
‚Ä¢ Times Square billboard campaign funded entirely by whales (yes, real footage exists).
	
‚Ä¢ Community hosts spaces, memes, guides, and even markets it themselves.
	
‚Ä¢ No bots. No airdrop armies. No team incentives.
	
‚Ä¢ Website: https://img.money includes a live rewards calculator and contract links.

‚∏ª

Upcoming Utilities & Ecosystem:

The dev is active (public Telegram, X posts) and working on:
	
‚Ä¢ CEX integrations with hybrid models that support Token-2022 tax handling (e.g., MEXC, Bitget, BYDFi).
	
‚Ä¢ A Coin Collab platform ‚Äì allowing other tokens to plug into the $IMG rewards engine.
	
‚Ä¢ A Solana-based roulette game with IMG-powered mechanics.
	
‚Ä¢ Broader Token-2022 onboarding kits for new devs (making this the standard).

This isn‚Äôt a short-term cash grab ‚Äî it‚Äôs positioning $IMG as a foundational protocol for SOL-based passive yield.

‚∏ª

The Rugpull Argument? Let‚Äôs Kill It.

Rugs usually rely on:
	
‚Ä¢ Changing contract logic
	
‚Ä¢ Insider wallets
	
‚Ä¢ Dumpable dev allocations
	
‚Ä¢ Fake utility and hype

$IMG has none of that. It‚Äôs structurally unruggable:
	
‚Ä¢ No one can change the fee.
	
‚Ä¢ No one can mint or burn tokens.
	
‚Ä¢ No one controls the funds once the logic is in motion.

Even when the dev was hospitalized for several days, rewards kept flowing every 5 minutes. That‚Äôs not a red flag ‚Äî that‚Äôs resilience.

‚∏ª

For the FUDders:

You‚Äôre gonna comment ‚Äúscam,‚Äù ‚Äúrug,‚Äù ‚Äúbitconnect 2.0‚Äù ‚Äî we get it.
But ask yourself this:

Would a scam:
	
‚Ä¢ Launch 100% fair with no presale?
	
‚Ä¢ Lock the fee and config on-chain?
	
‚Ä¢ Distribute real SOL (not tokens) every 5 minutes?
	
‚Ä¢ Build community tools, utilities, and new integrations?

This is crypto. We reward conviction.
If it‚Äôs not for you? Scroll past.
But if you‚Äôre still reading‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs worth watching.

And if you still choose to FUD ‚Äî thanks for the engagement boost.
Every comment, every downvote, every triggered reply only pushes us further.
We‚Äôre living rent-free in your head‚Ä¶ and paying SOL every 5 minutes while we do it. <3

Meanwhile, $SPU is a slow cook.
While the market was crashing, $SPU was building.

When other projects went silent, $SPU dropped new content.
When paperhands cried, $SPU added real holders.
While rugs got exposed, SPU was shaping a CULT.

But this project is not just a meme. SPU offers
- Real sculptures made from recycled materials
- Hilarious cartoons animated from real, handmade art
- A full original IP
- New Streetwear Clothing Line launched during the worst market conditions

The dev? Fully doxxed. No hiding. A real artist, building for 10 years before even thinking about launching a token.

SPU didn‚Äôt rush. SPU didn‚Äôt fake hype. SPU slow-cooked its way through one of the roughest crypto cycles in history.

Only a few projects are still standing.
SPU is not just standing. It‚Äôs READY.

If you want a project that‚Äôs real ‚Äî with real art, real people, real culture ‚Äî welcome to the Spare Parts Universe.

This won‚Äôt be some generic post about how we‚Äôre going to the moon, 100x incoming etc. I just want more people to know about the project and how it can help further your own cause. 

They currently allow you to create agents for x, teams, slack and even YouTube and TikTok. Agents will post in a set interval and will help your community to get more eyes on it. 

For a small cap project to be among the most mentioned projects on X is something special. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there, they also have a Mod agent for Telegram and Discord, you can implement that into your chat in order to welcome new members, inform the masses and remove bad apples when the mod team is m.i.a. 

By holding $20 worth of nsai you can set up agents, that do any of the things mentioned above. PaalAI asks $3K for something with the same utility. 

Looking at what these guys have done it‚Äôs pretty impressive. And it actually helps out other projects. Any project starting out could really use everything they have to offer. 

Check out what they can do, there‚Äôs plenty of agents already running. One of my fave ones is CTroastagent on X. 

Hope to see more out there, for the future of AI and the future of crypto.

2025-04-24,"If you had to bet on one memecoin, which one would it be? I would consider investing in Giga because there‚Äôs a clear disconnect between how well-known the meme is and the relatively low market cap of the token. In the world of crypto, especially with meme coins, attention and community engagement often drive value more than traditional fundamentals. Giga already has a recognizable presence online, yet its token valuation hasn‚Äôt caught up to that level of visibility. This kind of imbalance suggests the project may be undervalued relative to its cultural impact. When interest, awareness, and community are already in place but the market cap remains modest, it creates a potential opportunity for early entry before broader adoption or speculative momentum kicks in. Unlike hype-driven pumps with no foundation, Giga already has the meme appeal and reach‚Äîwhat it lacks is recognition from the broader investor base. That gap could close quickly if sentiment shifts, which makes it worth considering from a risk/reward standpoint.

2025-04-24,"Ice bucket 2025 Just made a new meme coin on pump.fun ‚Äì Ice Bucket Challenge 2025 ‚Äì $ICE

Body:
Hey degens, meme lovers, and crypto explorers,

I just launched a new meme coin on pump.fun called $ICE ‚Äî and yes, it‚Äôs that kind of ICE. The freezing cold, chaotic, nostalgia-fueled tribute to the one and only Ice Bucket Challenge is back‚Ä¶ but now it lives on the blockchain. This is Ice Bucket Challenge 2025, and it‚Äôs colder, weirder, and more memeable than ever.

If you're looking for a coin with no roadmap but maximum personality, a weirdly wholesome backstory, and enough icy energy to go viral ‚Äî you're in the right place. Let me walk you through what $ICE is, why I made it, what the vision is (both meme and meta), and how we might actually do some good with this ridiculous creation.

What is $ICE?
At its core, $ICE is a meme coin born on pump.fun, designed to capture the chaotic spirit of viral trends while giving a cold splash of nostalgia for those who remember the Ice Bucket Challenge from back in the day.

We‚Äôre talking:

Pure meme energy
Absurd utility potential
Community-driven movement
Real-world tie-in with a twist of charity
The idea is simple: take one of the most iconic internet challenges ever ‚Äî something that actually united the internet for a good cause ‚Äî and bring it back as a crypto-powered movement in 2025. But instead of dumping ice water on your head, you‚Äôre dumping cold coins into the wild and watching the world react.

The Vibes
$ICE is not just a coin ‚Äî it‚Äôs an event. A vibe. A culture. It‚Äôs that shiver-down-your-spine moment when a coin goes viral for no logical reason, and you realize you‚Äôre witnessing something weirdly beautiful.

But here‚Äôs the secret sauce: beneath all the memes, there's a core of meaning.

We‚Äôre not pretending to reinvent anything. We're just remixing the internet‚Äôs favorite trend into something chaotic, loud, and possibly even impactful. It‚Äôs a coin made for Reddit. For Twitter. For Discords full of degenerates and dreamers.

We meme hard. We laugh harder. But maybe, just maybe ‚Äî we also do some good.

Utility? Kinda. Here‚Äôs the $ICE Plan (aka ""The Cold Roadmap""):
1. Freeze-to-Earn

Staking your $ICE? We're calling it ""Freezing."" When you freeze your tokens, you‚Äôll earn passive rewards over time. The colder you go (longer freeze), the higher your yield.

2. NFT Challenges

Remember the original Ice Bucket Challenge where you had to tag people? We‚Äôre gamifying that. You‚Äôll be able to mint limited edition Challenge NFTs if you complete wallet-based ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù (like freezing a certain amount, tagging other wallets, or buying during peak volatility).

3. Burn Events

When we hit certain milestones, a percentage of $ICE gets burned in a themed ‚Äúmelt-off.‚Äù Think: ‚ÄúGlobal Warming Day‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Great Defrost.‚Äù

4. Charity Tie-In

We‚Äôre reserving a portion of the supply or transaction tax (still being voted on by the early community) to go to ALS research, just like the original challenge intended. We'll use community polling to vote on which legit organizations get donations.

5. Social Challenges

We‚Äôll launch TikTok-style challenges and reward the best ice-related content with tokens or NFTs. The weirder, the better. Full memetic warfare.

Tokenomics (Simple and Transparent)
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000
Launch Platform: pump.fun
Liquidity: 100% community-owned after launch
No presale, no VCs, no insiders
Dev wallet: 0%
Community wallet (for burns, NFTs, challenges, and charity): 10%
Freeze-to-Earn rewards pool: 15%
No sketchy mechanics. No promises of Lambos. Just vibes, freezing cold memes, and a shot at something viral.

Why Did I Create This?
Honestly? Because I missed when crypto was fun.

I got tired of charts, rugs, and fake promises. I wanted to make something absurd, but also grounded in something real. The Ice Bucket Challenge was a rare moment when the internet united around something bigger than itself ‚Äî and even though this coin is 99% memes, I still think that feeling is worth chasing.

$ICE is my tribute to the ridiculous, heartfelt chaos that makes the internet magic. It‚Äôs about making noise, making memes, and maybe making a little difference along the way.

Who Should Join?
Meme coin hunters looking for the next community-based gem
Degens who love pump.fun chaos
People who were online in 2014 and remember getting soaked
Anyone who wants to ride the line between irony and sincerity
Those who believe crypto should sometimes just be fun
Whether you‚Äôre a day-one ICE lord or just found out about this post ‚Äî you‚Äôre welcome here.

What‚Äôs Next?
First freeze challenge: coming soon
NFT minting: in the works
Meme contest: launching this week
Community donation vote: once we hit 1,000 holders
Discord and Telegram going live shortly
Website coming once someone in the community volunteers to make it (this is 100% bootstrapped)
Final Thoughts
$ICE is a meme coin with cold potential. It‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs nostalgic, it‚Äôs community-first, and it‚Äôs unapologetically ridiculous. But it also has heart. If you‚Äôve been waiting for something a little different, a little colder, and a lot more fun ‚Äî this might be the one.

We‚Äôre not promising riches. But we are promising a wild ride, a lot of laughs, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî some real impact.",Positive

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We took what Axie got right‚Äîand we learned from where it cracked:

o¬†¬† ¬†No infinite emissions ‚Äì Real demand

o¬†¬† Not just rewards

o¬†¬† ¬†No farm bots

o¬†¬† ¬†A game that rewards skill, not grinding

¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The tokenomics aren‚Äôt just patched up. They‚Äôre engineered for longevity. Supply goes down. Demand goes up as the game expands. And the token becomes more valuable the more it‚Äôs used.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Right now, the market cap is low. And that‚Äôs fine. Because the real flip happens when the game goes live. That‚Äôs when utility meets visibility. And if you‚Äôre early‚Äîlike Axie early‚Äîyou already know what comes next

 Why the Hype Is Real:

Fair Launch: No presale. No ‚Äústealth for whales.‚Äù Just real distribution.

Transparency: Fully doxxed founder (Peter Senius), real devs, locked liquidity.

Massive Market Fit: It‚Äôs building a decentralized creator platform on Solana ‚Äî think ‚ÄúWeb3 Patreon, but less corporate cringe.‚Äù

**Why You Should Join a Meme Coin Investing Group Chat: The Ultimate Guide to Turning Laughs into Gains**

If you've spent any time online in the past few years, you've definitely come across meme coins‚Äîcryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and more recent entrants that started as jokes but ended up delivering serious profits. What started as internet humor quickly turned into an explosive, culture-driven phenomenon that continues to disrupt traditional finance. The question is: are you just going to watch it happen, or are you going to get involved?

If you‚Äôve ever thought about investing in meme coins‚Äîor if you already are‚Äîyou *need* to be in a group chat. And not just any group chat, but one filled with like-minded, motivated, and informed people who are chasing profits and having fun doing it.

Here‚Äôs why joining a meme coin investing group chat might be one of the best moves you make in your crypto journey.

---

### **1. Real-Time Alpha (Insider Info)**
Meme coin markets move FAST. By the time mainstream crypto Twitter is talking about a coin, the early birds have already made their money. Group chats are where you‚Äôll often hear about these plays first‚Äîfrom someone who saw a trending post on Reddit, TikTok, or Telegram, or who‚Äôs been deep in the project‚Äôs Discord.

These communities act like living, breathing trend radars. They‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for undervalued gems, stealth launches, and early projects that have moon potential. When you‚Äôre in a good group chat, you‚Äôre not investing alone‚Äîyou‚Äôre investing with a collective mind that watches the market 24/7.

---

### **2. Learn From Others**
If you‚Äôre new to meme coins, navigating the space can be overwhelming. What‚Äôs a rug pull? What‚Äôs a honeypot? How do you use Uniswap or PancakeSwap? What even is gas?

These are the types of questions that you might feel awkward asking on public forums‚Äîbut in a group chat, there‚Äôs no pressure. You‚Äôll find people who are more experienced and happy to help guide you. Think of it like crypto office hours. Ask, learn, grow.

Even if you're a seasoned investor, you‚Äôll pick up tips and tricks from other experienced degens. From chart analysis and liquidity pool breakdowns to tokenomics and community sentiment, you‚Äôll absorb knowledge just by being part of the convo.

---

### **3. Avoid Scams and Rug Pulls**
The meme coin space can be wild. With every legit opportunity comes a dozen shady projects. A good group chat acts as a filter‚Äîyou get collective due diligence from people who can sniff out red flags and bad vibes.

Members will often share contract audits, developer wallet tracking, or even personal experiences with certain coins. You‚Äôre far less likely to fall for a scam when you have 50 other people helping you vet every opportunity.

---

### **4. Memes + Money = Fun**
Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîinvesting in meme coins isn‚Äôt *just* about profit. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs chaotic. It‚Äôs exciting. Group chats reflect that vibe. Expect lots of memes, GIFs, inside jokes, and pure entertainment, all while you‚Äôre watching your portfolio pump.

Crypto can be stressful. But when you‚Äôre in a group chat, even the losses hurt less when you can laugh about them with friends. And when you win? You get to celebrate those gains with people who get it. It‚Äôs a community. A tribe. A digital degen family.

---

### **5. Community-Driven Projects**
Some of the most successful meme coins started with just a small group of believers who hyped, bought in early, and pushed the project to the moon. Group chats are often the launchpads for these kinds of movements.

Sometimes, the group *becomes* the project‚Äîmembers pool resources, create their own coin, and promote it together. If you‚Äôre in early, that‚Äôs when the real upside happens.

Being in the right group chat can put you at the ground floor of the next viral token. You‚Äôre not just watching crypto history‚Äîyou‚Äôre making it.

---

### **6. Motivation and Momentum**
Let‚Äôs face it: staying motivated in crypto can be hard when you‚Äôre doing it alone. Maybe you bought a few coins, they dipped, and you feel discouraged. Or you don‚Äôt know what move to make next.

In a group chat, you‚Äôre surrounded by people chasing the same goal: financial freedom, one meme coin at a time. That energy is contagious. Seeing others succeed pushes you to keep grinding, researching, and trying again.

It‚Äôs like having your own crypto accountability squad‚Äîpeople who‚Äôll keep you in the game when it gets tough, and cheer you on when you score.

---

### **7. Early Whitelists, Giveaways, and Airdrops**
Another big perk of being in a solid meme coin group chat is access to exclusive opportunities. Devs often reach out to active communities with whitelist spots for new launches, airdrop giveaways, and early access tokens.

If you're part of an engaged chat, you‚Äôll get first dibs on these chances. And trust me‚Äîgetting into a presale before the public knows about it? That‚Äôs where real money is made.

---

### **8. Grow Your Network**
Crypto isn‚Äôt just about coins‚Äîit‚Äôs about people. You never know who you might meet in a meme coin group chat. It could be a future business partner, a dev with a project, an influencer, or just a really sharp trader whose insights change how you look at the market.

These chats are more than just channels for tips‚Äîthey‚Äôre communities where friendships are formed, collaborations happen, and doors open. It‚Äôs not what you know, it‚Äôs who you know‚Äîand in crypto, who you know *can* make you rich.

---

### **So‚Ä¶ Ready to Join?**
If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre probably at least *curious* about what it‚Äôs like inside one of these group chats. Maybe you‚Äôve been trading on your own, refreshing CoinGecko every 10 minutes, or lurking on Twitter trying to find the next 100x play.

Stop going solo. Come join the hive mind.

There‚Äôs power in community. There‚Äôs profit in information. And there‚Äôs potential in memes. Don‚Äôt wait for the next Dogecoin to pass you by while you‚Äôre on the sidelines. Plug into a meme coin group chat and *be* early for once.

Whether you‚Äôre here for the money, the memes, or the movement‚Äîwe‚Äôve got a spot for you. All you have to do is join.

Let‚Äôs chase those gains together.

2025-04-21,"Doge Day and the Rise of Event-Driven Trading Opportunities Navigating today‚Äôs crypto market requires both timing and flexibility. With increasing volatility and fragmented narratives across different sectors, traders are now leaning more toward short-term momentum opportunities, especially around meme-driven assets.  
   
While long-term plays still hold value, many are actively participating in niche events and  campaigns that align with trending tokens, which is quite a good way to add more to one asset

Along the line, I see many events hosted in light of Doge Day, And one that caught my attention the most is Bitget two community-focused initiatives.   
  
The first was a meme contest with a 1,000 USDT prize pool, and 20 winners will receive 50 USDT each. Though the contest has ended, the second event is still open. The ""Doge Day Carnival"" runs until April 25, inviting futures traders to engage with $DOGE, $SHIB, $FLOKI, and other related pairs. A total of 50,000 USDT is up for distribution based on trading performance.

These types of initiatives reflect how exchanges are adapting to maintain engagement during periods of uncertain market direction, and they offer active traders structured opportunities to earn while participating in popular narratives.",Positive

2025-04-22,"[RANT] TigerBackwoods should be the next Pope and I will DIE on this hill I don‚Äôt care what denomination you are. Catholic, Protestant, Agnostic, or full-blown Discord mod ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter. The Vatican needs a rebrand, and the only creature capable of leading the divine resurgence is an anthropomorphic cigar-chomping tiger robe named TigerBackwoods.

¬†

**Let me explain before you downvote me into exile:**

The church is in crisis. Attendance is down. Vibes are low. Gold ceilings can‚Äôt fix spiritual rug pulls. We need a Pope who understands the modern soul ‚Äî a Pope who can stake faith on-chain and mint salvation at scale. Someone like Tigerbackwoods

TigerBackwoods isn‚Äôt just a meme. He‚Äôs a movement. He burns tokens like incense. He doesn‚Äôt just walk on water ‚Äî he moonwalks on market caps while holding a chalice full of bourbon and muttering, ‚ÄúBlessed are the degens, for theirs is the kingdom of liquidity.‚Äù

¬†

You think that‚Äôs blasphemous?

Good.

So did the money changers before Jesus flipped the tables.

Tiger would‚Äôve flipped the entire banking system and replaced it with a DAO.

¬†

Give him the mitre. Let him light a Backwoods cigar with the Eternal Flame. Etch the commandments in solid gold cold wallets:

¬†Thou shalt not dump on thy brethren

No presale without purpose

Forgive, but never forget the rug

Gas fees shall be light

Meme coins shall be holy

¬†

This is bigger than crypto. This is spiritual infrastructure. This is a tiger sent by the market gods to remind us that faith is not dead ‚Äî it‚Äôs just been illiquid.

Make him Pope. Put him on the balcony. Let the smoke turn green.

And if the College of Cardinals won‚Äôt elect him? Fine.

¬†

We fork the Vatican.

We build a decentralized church.

And we call it the Holy Order of the Liquidity Reserve.

As the world holds its breath for the next Vicar of Christ, Solana just got its own Papal prophecy. Enter $POPE, the meme token inspired by the man behind the Vatican curtain ‚Äì Cardinal Pietro Parolin.

Seen as the moderate ‚Äúcontinuity candidate‚Äù, Parolin has been a key architect of modern Vatican diplomacy.

Some say he‚Äôs a pragmatic modernist who‚Äôs too cozy with secular powers. Others see a visionary pushing the Church toward a new age of global peace. But one thing‚Äôs certain ‚Äì he moves like a boss.

Whether you think he‚Äôs the last Pope, the next Pope, or the Crypto Pope, $POPE embodies that sacred blend of drama, diplomacy, and destiny.
Born on Solana. Fueled by memes. Divinely volatile.

2025-04-24,"Bullish NEW tokenomics for OG infra project POKT: new burn, new utility, end to new inflation. READ THE THESIS! I‚Äôve been in crypto since 2017. In the Solana trenches, Ethereum alts back pre-2020s, bet big on DeFi in the era when APYs were too long for mobile screen sizes.

Through this time, there‚Äôs been an OG infra company doing RPC - and now open data - that‚Äôs been around. It wasn‚Äôt always a good token (crazy inflation back in the day) - but I‚Äôve been tracking them for a few yrs and IMO there‚Äôs a big reason to be bullish.

**TLDR: I‚Äôm bullish on Pocket Network ($POKT), and here‚Äôs why you should be too.**

Main point: they‚Äôre about to launch the Shannon update which will totally rework the tokenomics, add a new line of business, and most importantly: KILL inflation/new issuance, while **introducing token burn tied to usage**. That last bit is important: *Pocket clears +500m RPC calls every damn day,* so we‚Äôre looking at a formerly *inflationary* asset *that‚Äôs now* ***deflationary****.*

# 1. Best Price/Performance for RPC: Pocket‚Äôs Web3 Infrastructure Edge

With the Shannon upgrade, POKT becomes the **lowest-cost RPC provider** in the Web3 space. That‚Äôs vs Alchemy, Infura, Quiknode - all of them. They‚Äôre not necessarily the best for everything, but they‚Äôre about to be the cheapest - **up to 75% cheaper competition**. dApps NEED RPC infra to exist, and Pocket‚Äôs going to be the go-to solution. They already make up a double-digit % of Alchemy‚Äôs RPC supply. They‚Äôre eating the market and no one knows about it.

# 2. Token Inflation? Gone. Burn Mechanism + DAO-Controlled Supply

Forget inflation. With **burn-to-use** tokenomics, every relay burns POKT, driving **deflation** and linking supply directly to usage. Plus, only the **DAO** can mint new tokens, ensuring supply remains in check and tied to actual network demand. It‚Äôs an EIP-1559-style burn mechanic but with a **use-case-driven** twist.

# 3. Expanding into AI & Open Data: POKT Powers LLM training on decentralized data

Pocket‚Äôs **open data** play is pretty interesting. The network will now serve **AI inference** traffic and fuel LLMs (think LLaMa & DeepSeek training), with a supply side of on and off-chain data providers serving the growing demand of AI builders. This AI boom makes data a premium asset. Payment? All in POKT. The **total addressable market** (TAM) just went **way up**, and usage = burn.

# TL;DR: Pocket ($POKT) is Positioned to Pop for Growth

1. **Best price/performance on RPC**: Newly cheapest, most decentralized, censorship-desistant, must-have Web3 infra.  
2. **From inflationary to deflationary asset:** Deflationary loop tied to real-world usage (AKA a ‚Äúbusiness model‚Äù for you non-crypto peeps) = sustainable value  
3. **AI & Data Expansion**: New line of business = new line of burn

POKT is looking solid as a long-term bet with utility-driven tokenomics & real fundamentals. A revenue-generating business model even, but don‚Äôt wanna scare anyone away.

**Network launch is mid-May, so smart money (and me) are loading up prior.** There was already a $2mm volume day this week, so folks are sniffing this out. Get your back, diamond hand through launch and deflation, ???, retire.

2025-04-23,"How are people handling crypto payments today? Curious what flows actually work in real life We‚Äôve been digging into how crypto payments are handled outside of exchanges - specifically peer-to-peer, freelancer gigs, client work, digital product sales, etc.

There‚Äôs a lot of infrastructure for sending tokens, but **the actual user experience** still seems rough:

* Wallet addresses shared manually
* Unclear chain support
* Payment amount conversions done off-platform
* No trust mechanism for completion

If you‚Äôve ever received or sent crypto for a service, we‚Äôd love to hear:

* What‚Äôs your current setup? (Wallets, steps, tools?)
* Do you use fixed tokens like USDC, or just go with what the client has?
* Have you had issues with chains, confirmations, or wrong tokens?
* What‚Äôs the one pain you wish someone solved?

We‚Äôre trying to better understand where the real friction is.

Not promoting - just trying to learn from folks actually dealing with this stuff day-to-day.",Neutral
